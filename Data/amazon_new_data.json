The Nashville drivers NewsChannel 5 spoke to say it's something they struggle with every day. \"You look out there now, it's the middle of the day, and it's already backed up,\" Thompson said.\n\nBut -- is America's Music City really the worst in the nation? \"That would shock me, especially coming from California,\" said Vini Haro, a new Nashvillian who just moved here from the West Coast.\n\nJust to be clear, according to Forbes, it's not that Nashville has the longest commute. But there are other factors, like road conditions, that bump the city way down. Tredesha White learned that the hard way when she got a flat tire Tuesday morning. \"I'm trying to fix the tire right now; the roads are horrible, and I feel like they need to do a better job of getting it together,\" said White.\n\nThe Forbes study also factors in access to public transportation and walkability. But the truly scary part for Nashville drivers -- there doesn't seem to be a quick fix to end this traffic nightmare. \"When you add the summer and the tourists and the traffic, forget about it,\" Thompson said. \"It's just getting worse.\"\n\nGet NewsChannel 5 Now, wherever, whenever, always free.

(WTVF) -- The Middle Tennessee couple who said UBuildIt Nashville made them homeless is preparing to go to court.\n\nUnderstandably, Joseph and Kimberly Story didn't expect to have to live in their Chevy Malibu while their home was built. After all, they signed a contract with the company more than a year ago. But for the better part of the year, they've been living in their car with three dogs.\n\nWe are following up on their situation because like you, we care how their story ends.\n\nIn August of 2022, the couple signed a contract with the company's owner, Michael Sizemore, and gave him a $165,000 check for a 3-bedroom home to be built. So far, all they have to show for that money is some cleared land in Beechgrove and footers for a foundation.\n\nThe issues they first revealed to NewsChannel 5 in September are now spelled out in a complaint filed in a Williamson County civil court. A lawyer has taken on their case pro bono.\n\nThe complaint argues the Storys were defrauded, their contract was breached, there was intentional neglience and Sizemore's actions are in violation of the consumer protection act. Additionally, she alleges the work done at a Beechgrove property for the Story home were done illegally, without permits pulled.\n\n\"You know, I didn't want to go this far, I didn't want to go to court. I don't want to go to court. We want our house or give us all our money back,\" said Joseph.\n\nPeople gave roughly $2,800 to a GoFundMe set up for the Storys. It helped the Storys stay out of the elements and in a hotel for a few weeks.\n\n\"We're thankful for everyone who's helped us. We more than appreciate it. Thank you!\" said Kimberly.\n\nThe Storys are seeking at least $275,000 in damages from Sizemore and his company.\n\nGet NewsChannel 5 Now, wherever, whenever, always free.

        "body": "KENWOOD -- President Barack Obama's neighbors are worried that when he leaves the White House, the tourists will invade his block.\n\nSince Obama was sworn in as president in 2009, his block has been closed off by the U.S. Secret Service to everyone who didn't have business on the block.\n\nThat's meant life has been very quiet near Obama's house, at 5046 S. Greenwood Ave.\n\n\"It's probably one of the few places in the city where you can leave your Amazon packages for Christmas on the doorstep and not worry about it,\" said Stephen Phalen, who moved his family to the block just as Obama started his presidential run in 2008.\n\nHe said before Obama took the oath of office in January 2009 and the Secret Service shut off Greenwood Avenue, tour buses weren't uncommon on the block. He said he's worried it will be even worse after Obama leaves office if Greenwood is opened back up.\n\nFormer presidents get Secret Service protection for the rest of their lives, and their children get protection until they turn 16.\n\nThe Secret Service said it does not disclose information about security for a sitting or former president.\n\nOther neighbors said they're worried tourists will become inescapable.\n\n\"Even with the Secret Service presence, tourists can be very aggressive,\" said Lara Moynihan. \"Given that I am next door, I do worry about having tourists on my driveway and in my backyard taking photos at all hours of the day and night.\"\n\nEven now, tourists get as close to they can, coming up to the gates at the end of the block next to K.A.M. Isaiah Israel, at 1100 E. Hyde Park Blvd.\n\nRobert Nevel, who was president of the synagogue's congregation for much of Obama's tenure, said the tourist interest changes more with the weather than in response to whether the Obamas are home.\n\nHe said it's not uncommon to see two or more coach buses parked across Hyde Park Boulevard and let tourists out to take pictures of Obama's empty house.\n\n\"Even if they sell the house, it will still be a tourist attraction,\" Nevel said.\n\nSo far, there are no indications the Obamas will come back to live in the Kenwood house full time.\n\nObama said last spring during a trip to Milwaukee that his family will stay in Washington, D.C., until his daughter Sasha finishes high school, and he hasn't figured out what he'll do after that.\n\n\"Hawaii's home for me, but I spent almost 30 years in Chicago,\" Obama said. \"It's where I met Michelle; it's where she grew up. It's where our daughters were born.\"\n\nObama's presidential library will also be near the Kenwood house, in Jackson Park.\n\nBut people who followed Obama to the White House from Hyde Park and Kenwood, doubt he will return.\n\nAustan Goolsbee, former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under Obama, said at Obama's Tuesday farewell address that he wasn't sure whether Obama would ever move back to the South Side.\n\nHe said the Kenwood house might no longer fit the Obamas' lifestyle after the White House because both of their children will be in college, and they will be more focused on running their foundation.\n\nGoolsbee moved back to Hyde Park after his stint at the White House, and former U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan, an old friend and frequent basketball partner of Obama, recently moved back to the neighborhood.\n\nBut if Obama has plans to get the old gang back together, he hasn't told them yet.",

        "body": "ALLEN PARK -- C.J. Gardner-Johnson has already changed positions since arriving in Detroit back in the spring. Now he's back in the city for the first time since undergoing surgery on his pectoral, and announced he's changing names too.\n\nGardner-Johnson announced on X (which itself has gone through a name change) that he is officially adopting his \"Ceedy Duce\" alter-ego as his legal name.\n\n\"Officially changing my name to Ceedy Duce,\" Gardner-Johnson said. \"Court documents (on the way).\"\n\nThis isn't the first name change for the safety originally born Chauncey Gardner Jr. in Cocoa, Fla. He went on to star at the University of Florida by that name, before legally changing it to \"Chauncey Gardner-Johnson\" in 2017 to honor his stepdad, Brian Johnson, who raised him.\n\nGardner-Johnson eventually toyed with his first name too, ditching \"Chauncey\" for \"C.J.\" in the NFL.\n\nWhatever you want to call him, he's become a feared defensive back at this level, first as a slot cornerback in New Orleans -- where he played for Lions head coach Dan Campbell and defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn -- before leading the league in interceptions as a safety in Philadelphia last year.\n\nWhen contract negotiations with the Eagles broke down, Gardner-Johnson jumped at the opportunity to reunite with Glenn and Campbell in Detroit. He was expected to start at slot cornerback, but the emergence of rookie Brian Branch prompted the Lions to move him to safety.\n\nGardner-Johnson became Detroit's top player at that position in training camp, and his energy and fearlessness injected swagger into a defense that ranked as the league's worst last season.\n\n\"He is the battery for the whole defense out there,\" defensive backs coach Brian Duker once said.\n\nGardner-Johnson made early-season headlines for wearing a ski mask to the season opener in Kansas City. He said he was adopting the \"villain\" moniker that was first suggested by general manager Brad Holmes, and encouraged fans to wear ski masks to the home opener at Ford Field in Week 2. So many fans obliged that Amazon briefly sold out of blue ski masks.\n\nBut disaster struck on the first defensive series of that game. Gardner-Johnson suffered an injur that briefly forced him from the game. Subsequent medical testing revealed a tear in the pectoral muscle, and CJGJ underwent surgery that has sent him to injured reserve. There is still some hope he returns in time for the playoffs.\n\nIt seems like recovery is moving quickly, considering he can already do pushups.\n\n\"I seen him do a pushup, no cap,\" fellow safety Kerby Joseph said on Friday. \"I saw him do a pushup. That's what's up though. I'm glad to see my boy here, excited to get him back out here, you know what I'm saying? Just wish him the best, wish him a speedy recovery.\"",

All we'll say is this: when we headed downtown with them, they couldn't have been more popular.\n\nThe music. The people. The energy. Trips to Nashville are always loved by Sarah Jayne and Andy Crust.\n\n\"It's very different from home because we're at the home of country music,\" said Sarah Jayne. \"We're so welcomed as British people here. We just love the atmosphere. We're from Ashford and Kent, about an hour from London. We've been married for over 20 years.\"\n\nSo, what is it that they do?\n\n\"We are Europe's leading Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers tribute, and we have a touring production show called the Country Superstars,\" smiled Sarah Jayne.\n\nSarah Jayne's played Dolly for 30 years. She and Andy now perform about 100 shows a year.\n\n\"We've been fortunate,\" Andy said.\n\n\"We tour all over the UK, bringing country music to people who just love it, and there's millions of people that do!\" Sarah Jayne laughed.\n\nSarah Jayne said the music about love of family and overcoming adversity is just universal.\n\n\"It's because it comes from the heart,\" she continued.\n\n\"They're more story songs, and they're really meaningful songs,\" Andy added.\n\n\"The country music that I listened to, it became part of my life,\" said Sarah Jayne.\n\nThey were in the city for an honor from the Josie Music Awards just held at the Grand Ole Opry. Of course, a downtown visit needed to happen.\n\nSarah Jayne and Andy walked around in character, singing songs and taking pictures.\n\n\"When people meet me as Dolly, they get quite excited,\" Sarah Jayne said. \"A lot of people cry. Although I'm not Dolly, they feel they're with Dolly which, from my point of view, I'm making that magic happen.\"\n\n\"As soon as the stuff comes off, I'm back to my Kent accent!\" said Andy.\n\nThe gig's not about looking identical to the artists. It's something else.\n\n\"We try to capture the heart of who they are,\" said Sarah Jayne. \"We want people to feel good about themselves.\"\n\n\"I'm grateful, and I count my blessings every day that I have this for a job,\" said Andy.\n\n\"People say I help them forget their troubles, their cares, and that's what Dolly does,\" said Sarah Jayne. \"Dolly's very good at making people feel good, and I'm happy to be a part of that.\"\n\nSarah Jayne tells us she has met Dolly Parton several times, and Dolly thanked them for what they do. She said it's beautiful to have that acknowledgement. The couple also does book readings through a UK affiliation of the Imagination Library.\n\nGet NewsChannel 5 Now, wherever, whenever, always free.

        "body": "CARBONDALE, Colo. -- The man whose body was found in a Colorado amusement park with a semi-automatic rifle nearby and a handgun at his side was described by his older brother Tuesday as a recluse who stayed up every night playing video games.\n\nDiego Barajas Medina, 20, whom the Garfield County Coroner's Office identified as the man whose body was found in a women's restroom before Glenwood Caverns Adventure Park opened Saturday, \"was a quiet person,\" his brother, David Barajas Medina, 27, said in an exclusive interview. \"He wouldn't talk to any of us.\"\n\nThe brothers lived with their mother in a two-bedroom apartment in Carbondale, about 14 miles south of the amusement park. David and Diego shared a room.\n\n\"He always wanted to be a police officer, so he had guns,\" David said. \"He had a vest.\"\n\nUnder Diego's bed was a box that, David said, may have stored the firearms authorities found, weapons the local sheriff said are most likely illegal, and unregistered and untraceable ghost guns that can be made at home with kits and 3D printers. David said he was at a loss for what was going on in his brother's mind.\n\n\"I didn't think he was a dangerous person,\" he said.\n\nAuthorities were trying to assess why Diego would go to the park before business hours carrying a rifle, described as looking like an AR-15; a handgun, believed to have been used to end his life; and explosives. He wore dark clothing in the style of police tactical officers, authorities said.\n\n\"He was highly prepared and highly weaponized but chose ultimately to kill himself,\" Garfield County Sheriff Lou Vallario said Monday at a news conference.\n\nFor a nation still recovering from last week's mass shooting in Lewiston, Maine, where 18 people were killed by a man said to have a similar semi-automatic rifle, the news of Diego's death at a venue for families and children has been unnerving. Colorado has a long history of mass shootings dating to 1999 at Columbine High School.\n\nThe amusement park, which is at an altitude of 7,100 feet, has a capacity of 1,551 people, according to Garfield County documents. It is in Glenwood Springs, a city of around 10,000 in the Rocky Mountains 120 miles west of Denver. Alongside thrill rides, the amusement park provides tours of caves beneath Iron Mountain.\n\nGlenwood Caverns Adventure Park said in a statement that the venue is surrounded by state land and that the man had trespassed.\n\nSheriff's spokesperson Walt Stowe said Tuesday, \"He was able to drive his vehicle up a back road that is used by the park for maintenance traffic only.\"\n\nHe described it as a dirt road \"with little or no maintenance.\"\n\nIt was not clear Tuesday how Diego knew about the road. David said his brother had no connection to the park.\n\nInvestigators also found fake hand grenades near Diego's body, Vallario said Monday.\n\nDiego wore a ballistic vest and a ballistic helmet and possessed multiple magazines of ammunition, authorities said. The patches and emblems on his dark clothing \"gave the appearance of being associated with law enforcement,\" the sheriff's office said in a statement Monday.\n\nVallario said, \"Whatever the intention, he did not follow through.\"\n\nDavid said he believes Diego meant no harm. Diego left a phone in the room they shared, he said, and it seems clear to him that Diego wanted someone to find it. David is not sure what was in the phone, which was locked. Like the box, investigators took the phone, his brother said.\n\nDiego lost his last job at Family Dollar about a year ago and was flipping items on Amazon to make ends meet, though he had not kept up with the rent, David said.\n\nHe may have been depressed, but Saturday's discovery was shocking, David said.\n\n\"I'm not sure what he was setting out to do,\" he said.\n\nHis described Diego as a nocturnal gamer: \"He went to sleep every day at 6 a.m. He played Call of Duty every night.\"\n\nEven so, David said, \"he seemed normal.\" And he described his death as \"weird to me.\"\n\nStowe said the sheriff's office will conduct a \"methodical and detailed\" investigation to reveal the man's background and possible motive, indicating it could take time and even then conclude speculatively.\n\nOn Monday, Vallario described Diego as \"completely under the radar,\" adding, \"There was nothing to indicate there was a warning or concern.\"\n\nHe imagined what could have been, saying Diego \"could have done a tremendous amount of damage at the adventure park.\"\n\n\"It could have been devastating,\" he said.\n\nInvestigators found writing on a bathroom wall near the body. Its meaning, or even whether it was done by Diego's hand, remained unclear Tuesday.\n\nVallario said the writing stated, \"I am not a killer, I just wanted to get into the caves.\"\n\nDeon J. Hampton reported from Carbondale, Minyvonne Burke from Pittsburgh and Dennis Romero from San Diego.",

They wanted to inspire families to work hard to achieve their dreams. \"A Million Miles Away\" was number one on Amazon Prime Video when it debuted in September. Hernandez was rejected 11 times to be an astronaut.\n\nHe applied for a 12th time and got accepted.\n\n\"Never give up on yourself,\" he said. \"In other words, have perseverance as a personal trait.\"\n\nSept. 15 to Oct. 15 was Hispanic and Latino Heritage Month. Hernandez says it's a month to celebrate the work others have done for future generations. His family immigrated from Mexico in the early 60s. He worked on a farm before pursuing his dream of becoming an astronaut. He says the month means a lot to him.\n\nRELATED: Farmworker turned astronaut Jose Hernandez urges kids not to give up\n\n\"It is the recognition of the contribution of Latinos in this country,\" he said, \"It means we need to pause and recognize everyone.\"",

        "body": "KANNAPOLIS -- It's not a trick, but instead, a treat for those who love science-fiction books as Kathleen Hannon of Charlotte has published her second book, one geared for young adults and with a Halloween-flavored story-line.\n\nInspired by Frankenstein, Hannon's newest book titled \"The Confession of Hemingway Jones,\" was released in September. Hannon shared it was planned and \"we were determined\" that the book would make its debut around Halloween.\n\nSet in Concord and Kannapolis, the book features many local spots in these two cities that residents will recognize including, she noted, Danny's Fried Chicken in Concord and all of Union Street. Additional area settings are Reed Gold Mine and Gold Hill Road, which she said is heavily featured.\n\nThe story begins, Hannon noted, with Jones, \"a 17-year-old genius who makes a bad decision and wrecks the car and kills his father\" thus opening the story with a modern day twist of cryogenic preservation.\n\nJones hijacks the lab where he is an intern and works to bring his father back to life, which happens but not the result hoped for, leaving his father as not entirely human.\n\nIn addition to the science-fiction and fantasy aspects, a love story is also woven into the work.\n\nIn developing the character, Hannon said that it \"just came to me. This character just came up in my head one night\" after reading various articles in Tech Talk which dealt with research on people who were bleeding out and if they could be put in suspended animation.\n\nThe storyline was being worked on during a time when vampire and werewolf stories were quite popular, leading Hannon to question, \"why isn't anyone dealing with Frankenstein, the beginning of science-fiction?\"\n\nStarting as early as the age of five, Hannon said she dreamed of being an author. Her career journey took her to working in Hollywood as a development executive with writers for quite some time.\n\n\"I never had the courage to write myself,\" Hannon said, until the writers' strike in 2008, which forced her to take a different route. \"There's not going to be something to edit unless I write it.\"\n\n\"The Confession of Hemingway Jones\" had been in the works for several years and was put on the shelf during a difficult time in her life. An old friend, who had become a publisher, wanted her work and the book was pulled off the shelf, she sent pages to her friend and in just a couple weeks, received an offer.\n\n\"The timing and delay in publishing the book worked in its favor,\" Hannon said, as \"so many ways people are contemplating how to extend human life.\"\n\nHannon pointed to artificial intelligence, cloning and other clinical studies as examples.\n\nA debate is going on with these studies, she shared, \"of what defines life and should we have that control which all goes back to Shelly and what he opened up with Frankenstein.\"\n\nHannon said, here in this AI age, there would be these ethical discussions, and said she wanted to offer young people something more to read than just a love story and \"just a debate about how to be nice.\"\n\nHannon added, \"I wanted to open that up to them and at least start the conversation in a way that is engaging and exciting.\"\n\nThe author anticipates additional books to come along in the future.\n\nFor those wishing to purchase a copy of this second book, they can be found online on Amazon as well as bookstores, including Park Road Books in Charlotte, Main Street Books in Davidson, and Books-A-Million locations.",

        "body": "FORT DODGE -- Allison Roderick has a warning and a pledge for rural residents of her county: The water from their wells could be contaminated, but the government can help make it safe.\n\nRoderick is the environmental health officer for Webster County in north-central Iowa, where a few thousand rural residents live among sprawling corn and soybean fields. Many draw their water from private wells, which are exempt from most federal testing and purity regulations. Roderick spreads the word that they aren't exempt from danger.\n\nMore than 43 million Americans rely on private wells, which are subject to a patchwork of state and local regulations, including standards for new construction. But in most cases, residents are free to use outdated wells without having them tested or inspected. The practice is common despite concern about runoff from farms and industrial sites, plus cancer-causing minerals that can taint groundwater.\n\nPeople are also reading...

You're cleaning with it. You're bathing in it -- and, nowadays, there are so many things that can make you sick,\" Roderick said.\n\nFederal experts estimate more than a fifth of private wells have concentrations of contaminants above levels considered safe.\n\nLike many states, Iowa offers aid to homeowners who use well water. The state provides about $50,000 a year to each of its 99 counties to cover testing and help finance well repairs or treatment. The money comes from fees paid on agricultural chemical purchases, but about half goes unused every year, according to the Iowa Department of Natural Resources.\n\nRoderick, who started her job in 2022, aims to spend every penny allotted to her county. Last spring, she snared an extra $40,000 that other counties hadn't used. She promotes the program online and by mailing piles of postcards. Traveling the countryside in a hand-me-down SUV from the sheriff's department, she collects water samples from outdoor spigots and sends them to a lab.\n\nWhen she finds contamination, she can offer up to $1,000 of state grant money to help with repairs, or up to $500 to cap an abandoned well.\n\nExperts urge all users of private wells to have them tested at least annually. Even if wells meet modern construction standards and have tested clean in the past, they can become contaminated as the water table rises or falls and conditions change above them. A faulty septic system or overapplication of fertilizer or pesticide can quickly taint groundwater.\n\nToo many residents assume everything is fine \"as long as the water is coming out of the tap and it doesn't smell funny,\" said Sydney Evans, a senior science analyst for the Environmental Working Group, a national advocacy organization that studies water pollution.\n\nThe main concerns vary, depending on an area's geology and industries.\n\nIn Midwestern farming regions, for example, primary contaminants include bacteria and nitrates, which can be present in agricultural runoff. In rural Nevada and Maine, arsenic and uranium often taint water. And, throughout the country, concerns are rising about the health effects of PFAS chemicals, widely used products also known as \"forever chemicals.\" A recent federal study estimated at least 45% of U.S. tap water contains them.\n\nFilters can help ensure safety, but only if they're selected to address the specific problem affecting a home's water supply, Evans said. The wrong filter can give a false sense of safety.\n\nEvans said people who wonder about possible contaminants in their area can ask to see test results from wells supplying nearby community water systems. Those systems are required to test their water regularly, and the results should be public, she said: \"It's a great place to start, and it's free and easy.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\nShe also said people who rely on private water wells should ask local health officials about eligibility for help paying for testing and possible repairs or filters. Subsidies are often available but not publicized, she said.\n\nA study by Emory University researchers published in 2019 found that all states have standards for new well construction, and most states require permits for them. However, the researchers wrote, \"even in states with standards for water quality testing, testing is typically infrequent or not conducted at all.\"\n\nSome longtime rural residents live in homes that have been in their families for generations. They often know little about their water source. \"They'll say, 'This is the well my grandfather dug. We've used it ever since, and no one's had an issue,'\" said David Cwiertny, director of the University of Iowa's Center for Health Effects of Environmental Contamination. They might not realize impure water can harm health over time, he said.\n\nSome states require inspection and tests of private wells when properties are sold. Iowa doesn't mandate such measures, although Webster County does. It's a good idea for homebuyers anywhere to request them, said Erik Day, who oversees the private well program for the Iowa Department of Natural Resources. He also recommends asking for a technician who can run a flexible scope down the well to visually inspect the inside.\n\nDay estimated fewer than 10% of Iowa's private well owners have them tested annually, even though testing can be free under the state grant program.\n\nIn Webster County, Larry Jones recently took advantage of free well testing at a weathered ranch house he bought west of Fort Dodge, in a subdivision bordering a large soybean field. Jones lives next door to the 54-year-old home, and he is refurbishing it as a place for his relatives to stay.\n\nRoderick, the county health official, sampled water from the well and found it was tainted with bacteria. She offered Jones $1,000 from the state grant to help get it fixed. He added a few thousand dollars of his own and hired a contractor.\n\n\"It's an investment for the future,\" he said. \"You're talking about your family.\"\n\nThe old well was made with a 2-foot-diameter concrete casing sunk vertically in sections about 60 feet into the ground. A smaller plastic pipe ran down the middle of the casing to water at the bottom. A pump pulled water up through the smaller pipe and into the home.\n\nLynn Rosenquist, who owns a local well-repair business, told Jones the well probably was original to the house and likely met standards when it was built. But at least one chunk of concrete had broken off and fallen in.\n\nRepairs took two days of heavy work by Rosenquist and his brother, Lanny, who are the third generation of their family to maintain wells. The brothers used a backhoe and small crane to remove much of the concrete casing. They replaced it with a narrower, PVC pipe, which they sealed with a cement mixture to prevent seepage from the surface. When finished, they \"shocked\" the system with a bleach solution, then flushed and tested again.\n\nSuch modern construction is less prone to becoming tainted, Roderick said. \"If it's not sealed airtight, bacteria can get in there and it's just gross,\" she said.\n\nGrossness is not the only thing Roderick considers. Besides E. coli and other bacteria, she tests for nitrates and sulfates, which can exist in farm or lawn runoff or come from natural sources, and for arsenic and manganese, which can occur in rock formations. She plans to add tests for PFAS chemicals soon.\n\nShe collects the water in small plastic bottles, which she mails to a lab. She enters information about each well into a state database. If the tests turn up contaminants, she advises homeowners of their options.\n\nRoderick said she enjoys the routine. \"I've met so many people -- and I've met a lot of dogs,\" she said with a laugh. \"I love the feeling that I'm really helping people.\"\n\nKFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.",

With bigwig neighbours such as Ivanka Trump, Jeff Kushner and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, the Obamas have certainly shifted to a prominent locality.\n\nThe house measures 8,200 square feet and is equipped with eight bedrooms. It also has a vast garden, a large kitchen and nine-and-a-half bathrooms. The former President didn't need to travel much to relocate to this residence as well since it happens to be just two miles away from the White House.\n\nHere are some of the pictures of Barack Obama's new residence. Reportedly, the mansion is worth 5 million pounds but Barack has leased the house from Joe Lockhart, a former press secretary of the White House during the era of Bill Clinton.\n\nWhile Donald Trump and the First Family get used to the White House, this certainly doesn't seem to be a bad place for the former President and his family to unwind!",

But you don't have to wait weeks for the discounted prices.\n\nRetailers are making sales available all month long, which is good for consumers.\n\n\"Retailers have begun starting their holiday sales a lot earlier in recent years. And this year we're expecting the prices you see right now to remain consistent all the way through Black Friday. This means you can start shopping and saving now without worrying about missing out on those blockbuster deals later on,\" said Samantha Gordon of Consumer Reports.\n\nTarget is dropping new deals every week leading up to Black Friday. For instance, buy four personal or beauty items, get a $5 gift card, or buy one, get one 50% off on select toys. And there is a new trend for discounts.\n\n\"I've been seeing some smaller brands, like online or direct-to-consumer online retailers have kind of been rolling out these sales specifically to their email subscribers. They want to kind of give them early access,\" said Jennifer Ortakles Dawkins, a senior retail reporter for Insider.\n\nSo subscribe and follow on social media.\n\nConsumer Reports has a couple of top-rated products to look out for in November.\n\nIf someone in your life could use a new tablet to stream video and play games, consider the Samsung Galaxy Tab S8. It's $547.99 at Walmart, and CR says the top-rated model is a great option for those who want an Android tablet with high performance.\n\nAn air fryer will delight those who love to cook. The Dash Tasti-Crisp Air Fryer is now $59.99 at Amazon. That model comes in at the top of all air fryers in CR's ratings.\n\n\"The one thing you should wait until Black Friday to buy is a new TV. We've seen year after year that TVs are always at their best possible price during the Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend. So if you're thinking about buying a new one, wait until then,\" said Gordon.",

        "body": "ALABAMA (WHNT) -- Casey McWhorter is scheduled to be the first man from Marshall County to die by execution.\n\nMcWhorter, now 49 years old, was sentenced to the death penalty in 1994, following the 1993 murder of Edward Lee Williams.\n\nEarlier this month, Governor Kay Ivey set a 30-hour time frame for McWhorter's execution. It is set to start at 12:00am on Thursday, November 16th and runs through 6:00am on Friday, November 17th.\n\nWith his execution date in just three weeks, he is now sharing more about his life prior to the murder, his life in prison, and his thoughts on his execution. Several recordings of conversations with his Spiritual Advisor, Rev. Dr. Jeff Hood, have been turned into a new book: The Casey McWhorter Tapes.\n\nThat book will soon be available on Amazon.\n\nIn one of the recordings, shared with News 19 on Friday, McWhorter spoke about his family. \"I know I let them down quite a few times in my life, so I'd like to leave them with something to smile about,\" he said.\n\nHis Spiritual Advisor, Rev. Dr. Jeff Hood said McWhorter has had a long time to think about the murder. \"This is somebody who recognizes that they were part of an awful crime,\" he said.\n\n\"I mean, he's had 30 years to think about what he did and he feels disgusted by it and saddened by it,\" Hood said.\n\nOver the years, McWhorter has made several attempts to appeal his sentence, however, those have all failed. Now, the group, Death Penalty Action, is leading a new charge to try and stop his execution.\n\nThey've launched an online petition, to try and bring attention to McWhorter's situation.\n\n\"We're talking about a gut who was just barely 18 at the time of his crimes, barely an adult,\" Death Penalty Action Executive Director, Abraham Bonowitz, said. \"Also, a person who did not have a unanimous jury.\"\n\nBonowitz is referring to a non-unanimous death penalty vote. In Alabama, when a jury votes on conviction in a death penalty case, only 10 of the 12 jurors need to agree. Bonowitz says there are several reasons they believe McWhorter should not be executed.\n\nDeath Penalty Action is against the death penalty and certain methods of execution. \"We know we can be safe from dangerous offenders, or people who have done awful things earlier in their life, and hold them accountable without executions because that's what we do in the vast majority of cases,\" Bonowitz said.\n\nHe said in most cases, \"murderers that are punished to death are not punished by death, they're punished by death by incarceration these days.\"\n\nRev. Hood said he speaks to McWhorter almost daily at this point. Hood had this to say about McWhorter's mindset going into the execution: \"He keeps saying, and I believe him, that he's at peace.\"\n\nMcWhorter is currently incarcerated at the Holman Correctional Facility in Atmore, Alabama.",

(WTVD) -- If you're getting more and more unwanted spam text messages, you're not alone.\n\nThese texts are not only annoying but continue to cost people real money.\n\n\"Scammers are kind of taking action and adjusting their scams to be more relevant and unfortunately...Americans are losing more money as a result,\" Giulia Porter with RoboKiller said.\n\nAccording to RoboKiller, an app that blocks spam calls and texts, Americans got 12 billion Robotexts just last month, that's a 9% increase from month over month.\n\nThe worse news: as we head into the holiday season, the number of spam text messages is expected to increase.\n\nSEE ALSO | 2 Wake County bakeries lose Facebook business pages to hackers\n\nPorter said it's hard to avoid these calls and texts.\n\n\"Scammers are targeting phone numbers at random. They have technology that is auto dialing or auto texting, you know, millions of phone numbers every hour,\" she said.\n\nThe most common Robotext happening right now involves shipping notifications claiming delivery is delayed. Scammers are also pretending to be with banks or big retailers like Amazon and texting supposed fraud alerts about purchases.\n\nSEE ALSO | Job search ends with Raleigh woman being scammed out of $3,000\n\nWhile RoboKiller data shows spam calls are down, Americans are losing more money to those calls that do come through. Porter said due to AI technology you need to be very careful what you say during these scam calls.\n\n\"So scammers getting access to a couple of your voice snippets -- by prompting you to say hello, or answer at the other end of a call -- they can use your voice to access accounts. By using AI technology that's called a deep fake,\" Porter said..\n\nWith a big election year in 2024, robocalls and texts are expected to get even worse. To try and cut down on spam texts and calls, don't have your phone number associated with your social media accounts. If you get an unwanted call or text, block the number.\n\nAlso, make sure your phone number is on the Do Not Call Registry. There are also several apps like RoboKiller and others that will block spam calls. Check with your cell phone provider as many also offer ways to cut down on unwanted calls.",

        "body": "BETHESDA, Md. (TND) -- People who own pressure cookers should be aware of this recall. It involves about 930,000 Insignia Multi-Function Pressure Cookers that pose a burn hazard.\n\nThe problem is the pressure cooker has incorrect volume markings on the inner pot. That can cause people to overfill the pot, which could lead to hot food and liquids being ejected when the pressure cooker is vented, using the quick release method, or opened while its contents are pressurized.\n\nBest Buy, where most of the pressure cookers were sold, has gotten 31 reports of the contents expelling under pressure, including 17 reports of burn injuries, some of them second-degree and severe burns.\n\nThe inner cooker pots are black with a non-stick coating and embossed markings indicating cup and liter measurements. The electric pressure cookers and inner cooker pots are six- and eight-quart capacity.\n\nThe pressure cookers being recalled have model numbers NS-MC60SS8, NS-MC60SS9, and NS-MC80SS9. There are also inner cooker pots sold separately as replacements with model numbers NS-MCRP6NS9 and NS-MCRP6SS9.\n\nThey were sold at Best Buy stores, and online through Best Buy and Amazon, from October 2017 through this past June, for between $50 and $120.\n\nThe Consumer Product Safety Commission says anyone with a recalled pressure cooker should stop using it and contact Best Buy by clicking here. Best Buy will replace the inner pot and floating locking valve for signaling pressure for free, for people who register online.\n\nSome other advice from the feds: Check that the inner pot is not filled beyond two-thirds capacity, that the lid is fully locked before starting pressure cooking, and that the floating locking valve has dropped before trying to open the lid.",

Here are the top stories from Oct. 21-27.\n\nTwo women were killed along Interstate 94 in St. Paul after their SUV struck a tire that came off a semi on Oct. 21. Troopers responded to a fatal crash in the eastbound lanes of I-94 near Highway 241 in St. Michael.\n\nAccording to troopers, a Freightliner semi was headed westbound when it \"lost two tires.\" At least one of the tires went flying, striking a 2023 Nissan Rogue headed eastbound.\n\nTwo women inside the Nissan were killed. Troopers identified them at 43-year-old Lea Khamphachanh of St. Cloud and 44-year-old Viengkhone Nguyen of Brooklyn Park.\n\nA rally in Minneapolis to support Palestinians was met with a confrontation on Oct. 22 as a car drove through a group of protestors.\n\nProtesters were rallying along the Irene Hixon Whitney Bridge, the pedestrian bridge that runs over I-94 in Loring Park. Along with having a protest on the bridge, some protesters were blocking traffic along streets that run along the bridge.\n\nPolice say they learned that a vehicle had driven through the crowd of protestors. Police say there were no injuries as a result of the incident, and they are reviewing what happened.\n\nMinnesota Attorney General filed an emergency motion and lawsuit against a property management company.\n\nEllison alleges that the landlord started charging thousands of tenants in numerous Minnesota apartment complexes for large electric and fees, in the middle of their leases, which is in violation of several laws.\n\nEllison stepped in to put an effort in to stop the property management company from evicting tenants who can't pay the large utility fees.\n\nTwo men were accidentally shot by children in separate incidents on Oct. 22 during the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources youth deer hunting season, according to authorities.\n\nIn the first incident, a 45-year-old man was shot by his 12-year-old daughter in the leg in Becker Township. The second happened in Helga Township, 165 miles north of Becker Township. A 50-year-old man was accidentally shot by a 10-year-old girl he was supervising while hunting. Both men were taken to the hospital.\n\nThose who knew the victims of the deadly Interstate 94 crash where two tires came off a semi and struck their SUV are now questioning if this incident involves negligence that could have been prevented.\n\nLea Khamphachanh and Viengkhone Nguyen were killed on Oct. 21 in the crash. State Patrol is not commenting on the ongoing investigation.\n\nThe shooting death of a 2-year-old by a 4-year-old who was riding in the same car has led to charges against a man who was with them and owned the gun.\n\nColton Dean Mammenga, 33, of Welcome, Minnesota, was charged Oct. 26 with two counts of second-degree manslaughter, one count of child endangerment, and one count of negligent storage of a firearm for possessing the gun that enabled the shooting to occur.\n\nThe westbound lanes of Interstate 94 reopened the morning of Oct. 24 after a double-fatal, fiery wreck in western Wisconsin shut down the roadway Oct. 23.\n\nWisconsin State Patrol reports two people were killed in the crash and six others were injured. Troopers say seven vehicles total were involved in the crash.\n\nThe University of Minnesota is asking for the public's help in locating a 19-year-old student who went missing on Oct. 21.\n\nThe Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension says that Sumith Maddi was last seen leaving the 17th Avenue Residence Hall on the University of Minnesota campus around 2:40 a.m. on Oct. 21.\n\nCall University of Minnesota Police at 612-624-2677 with any information on his location.\n\nAmazon employees who still refuse to comply with Amazon's return-to-office policy may soon get fired.\n\nBusiness Insider reported the company circulated new guidance to managers informing them they can now fire workers who fail to report to the office at least three days a week and laid out how such terminations should go.\n\nRamsey County law enforcement officials found 11 guns found at an Airbnb in Maple Grove, including guns stashed in board games and a McDonald's bag.\n\n\"The guns were in backpacks, purses, above the furnace, in the walls, behind couches,\" said Ramsey County Sheriff Bob Fletcher. \"This is the fourth Airbnb incident involving guns. We had three here in St. Paul. We had one in Roseville.\"",

The 11 other players on the roster, not including Clark, have 327 games, no starts and 1,076 points in 13 combined seasons with the Hawkeyes.\n\nBluder said getting Martin and Marshall back was a \"pleasant surprise.\"\n\n\"Kate is honestly one of the strongest leaders I've ever been around.,\" Bluder said \"She's a culture builder. She's playing like a pro right now. She really is. She's knocking down 3s. She's physically defending hard, rebounding. I think you're going to see Kate just jump off the stat sheet this year.\"\n\nMarshall struggled with her shot early last season but finished with a flurry, which played a part in her decision to return. She was 13 of 21 on 3s over three Big Ten Tournament games and 12 of 29 over five NCAA games.\n\n\"It was really a no-brainer for me,\" Marshall said of her return. \"You go back and forth in your head: 'Can I do this mentally, physically?' End of the day, these are the people I want to be around every day and I'm just trying to cherish this last season.\"\n\nWho's back\n\nIt all starts with Clark, obviously. The AP preseason All-American needs 811 points to become the all-time leading scorer in Division I. Known for her outrageously long 3-pointers, she comes into the season with 90 straight double-figure scoring games and a 27.3-points-per-game career average with 43 double-doubles and 11 triple-doubles.\n\nMartin made 41.3% of her 3s and averaged 7.7 points and 4.2 rebounds. Marshall averaged 6.2 points and led the team with 62 steals.\n\nAddison O'Grady, who had 10 points and 14 rebounds in the outdoor exhibition against DePaul at Kinnick Stadium, appears set to take Czinano's spot at center after getting limited minutes last year. Hannah Stuelke, the Big Ten sixth player of the year as a freshman, takes over for Warnock at forward.\n\nGuard Kylie Feuerbach, who missed last season with an ACL injury, is back along with Taylor McCabe. Molly Davis and Sydney Affolter also give the Hawkeyes quality depth at guard.\n\nWho's gone\n\nCzinano is gone after having amazing chemistry with Clark for three years. She often converted entry passes from the point guard and averaged 17.1 points and shot 67.4%. Warnock shot 38% on 3s and averaged 10.9 points and 5.9 rebounds.\n\nWho's new\n\nKennise Johnson of Joliet, Illinois, is the only true freshman who could play. She was the No. 3 guard prospect in Illinois last season and saw limited action in Iowa's two exhibitions.\n\nAva Jones of Nickerson, Kansas, signed a letter of intent in November, five months after the vehicle she and her family were riding in was struck by a driver under the influence in Kentucky. The crash killed her father and left Ava and her mother with serious injuries. Ava won't play this season but is attending classes while continuing treatment for her injuries.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nThe Hawkeyes open Nov. 6 at home against Fairleigh Dickinson. They play Final Four team and eighth-ranked Virginia Tech in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Nov. 9 and go to Ames on Dec. 6 for the CyHawk Game against Iowa State. Big Ten play begins Dec. 10 at Wisconsin.\n\nCaitlin Clark begins her run in the John Deere Classic Pro-Am\n\nCopyright 2023 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Chuck Grassley is seeking information from the Department of Justice and FBI about whether they properly vetted what he says were dozens of people who provided federal investigators with confidential, criminal information related to the foreign business dealings of President Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, and other family members.\n\nThe allegations were outlined in a letter published Wednesday from Grassley to Attorney General Merrick Garland and FBI Director Chris Wray.\n\nCiting anonymous whistleblower disclosures, Grassley said he had been made aware that the FBI had at one point maintained more than 40 confidential \"human sources,\" who had criminal information about President Biden, his son Hunter, and James Biden, the president's brother.\n\n\"An essential question that must be answered is this: Did the FBI investigate the information or shut it down? Indeed, if those sources were improperly shut down, it wouldn't be out of the ordinary for the FBI,\" Grassley wrote.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The Department of Justice and White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment Thursday.\n\nGrassley's request comes as House Republicans pursue an impeachment inquiry into President Biden over allegations he abused his authority when he was vice president to personally profit off his family's many foreign business dealings.\n\nPart of the House GOP inquiry involves examining how the DOJ handled its own parallel investigation into Hunter Biden after whistleblowers alleged the investigation had been slow-walked by department officials to protect the Bidens.\n\nGrassley, in the letter, accuses the department of stonewalling him on the issue since 2019, before Biden took office in 2021. He wrote the \"investigative activity was scuttled by the FBI in 2020,\" while former President Donald Trump was in office, and asserts that \"such decisions point to significant political bias.\"\n\nThe allegations against the Biden family were investigated by the Department of Justice under Trump-appointed Republican Attorney General William Barr as part of an investigation into allegations of bribery brought by Trump's then-personal attorney Rudy Giuliani.\n\nThe Justice Department found no supporting evidence of the allegations and closed the investigation in August 2020, according to a statement from Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., the ranking member on the House Oversight Committee.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\nBarr denies closing the investigation, and told The Federalist this summer the information was ultimately forwarded to the U.S. attorney in Delaware.\n\nRepublicans have questioned whether the federal prosecutor there followed up on the allegations.\n\nAn FD-1023 form used by the FBI to log unverified accounts from confidential human sources states the source \"is not able to provide\" information \"as to the veracity\" of assertions related to any alleged bribery.\n\nGrassley, in his letter, asserts certain FBI personnel allegedly attempted \"to sweep (the form) under the rug\" in part by falsely attributing it to foreign disinformation.\n\nBarr in early 2020 issued new rules and restrictions for opening investigations into politically sensitive individuals or entities, including requiring regular updates and that he approve any inquiry into a presidential candidate or campaign.\n\nBarr's memo followed a critical report from the Justice Department's inspector general on aspects of the FBI's Russia investigation, which began in the summer of 2016 during the presidential campaign.\n\nBarr also was explicit about his concerns around how foreign disinformation might impact investigations, stating no information coming out of Ukraine could be taken \"at face value,\" given the amount of politically driven disinformation that could emerge from that country.\n\nEx-FBI agent Timothy Thibault, who Grassley asserts was ordered to close \"an avenue of additional derogatory Hunter Biden reporting\" in October 2020, testified that the confidential source who was temporarily shut down was conservative author and activist Peter Schweizer, who is a senior contributor for far-right media organization Breitbart News, and not considered an unbiased source.\n\nSchweizer, president of the conservative-backed Government Accountability Institute, identified himself as the source in a podcast.\n\nGrassley said he will seek interviews from at least 25 DOJ and FBI personnel involved in the efforts to investigate the Biden family.\n\n\"Based on the information provided to my office over a period of years by multiple credible whistleblowers, there appears to be an effort within the Justice Department and FBI to shut down investigative activity relating to the Biden family,\" Grassley wrote in the letter. \"Such decisions point to significant political bias infecting the decision-making of not only the Attorney General and FBI Director, but also line agents and prosecutors. Our Republic cannot survive such a political infection, and you have an obligation to this country to clear the air.\"\n\nPhotos: Sen.

Texas was ranked fifth in the final AP poll after advancing to the NCAA Elite Eight for the first time since 2008.

Texas won 22 of its 30 games with Terry at the helm.\n\n\"From the outset of this journey with the group, we just said we had to have a growth mindset every day with what we're trying to improve, getting familiar with one another on the court every single day,\" Terry said. \"Just like any team as they start a season, there's going to be a number of different things you have to continue to get better with each and every day.\"\n\nIncarnate Word, which plays in the Southland Conference, went 12-19 last season and lost six of its final seven games. Senior forward Davante Dennis is the top returning scorer after averaging 8.3 points last season.\n\nThe Cardinals were picked to finish 10th (last) in the SLC preseason poll and are in their first year under Shane Heirman, who was hired in May after two seasons as associate head coach at Central Michigan.\n\n\"I need nastiness out there, I need competitors, I need grit,\" the 35-year-old Heirman said of his team. \"Because if you're going to get through this, it takes a great deal of toughness. We can create a game plan, we can X and O this thing to death, but there's no substitute for will.\"\n\nEven if Heirman's requirements are filled, the Cardinals will likely have a hard time staying with deep and talented Texas. The Longhorns have won the only two meetings between the programs, most recently a 78-33 victory in Austin in 2021.\n\n--Field Level Media\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Dcc Wire Fieldlevelmedia Tncen Football Ncaab Preview Top Story\n\nOriginally published on fieldlevelmedia.com, part of the BLOX Digital Content Exchange.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.",

(WTVF) -- It's a scene you expect in the heart of Music City -- a couple of musicians gathered around on a warm fall night, picking and strumming to a familiar tune.\n\nExcept this group, Delta, Charlie, Golf speaks a different language. These musicians are also battle-tested veterans. Some old with others quite young, some with visible injuries -- all with unseen wounds. And each one is now a graduate of the Guitars 4 Vets program, and proud owner of a brand new Taylor guitar.\n\n\"What we try to do at G4Vets is inspire our brothers and sisters who have served in the military and have experienced trauma. We try to inspire them to keep on living,\" said Patrick Nettesheim, co-founder of Guitars 4 Vets.\n\nThe nonprofit's mission is equally profound as it is simple: provide 10, 1 hour guitar lessons and let the music do the rest.\n\n\"It gives me a place where I can put my trauma into words and it gives me a place where I can feel it outside my body,\" said Malachias Gaskin, a veteran who spent 17 years in the Army. \"When you're sitting in front of a speaker and you're playing and you can feel the chords come across you it's just a different feeling.\"\n\nDarrell Wells made it a career. Each veteran gathered here with their own story of duty and sacrifice.\n\n\"When I was in the military, my last duty station was special forces. We're a group. We rely on one another,\" he said.\n\nGuitars 4 Vets has chapters in more than 45 states. They rely on volunteer instructors to provide the lessons and donated guitars.\n\nFor more information: https://guitars4vets.org/\n\nGet NewsChannel 5 Now, wherever, whenever, always free.

According to Paramount Global, streaming viewership is still growing, with the two-game lineup driving the most-streamed NFL on CBS doubleheader in October.\n\nSecond place this week went to the Los Angeles Rams vs. Dallas Cowboys, which drew nearly 20M people to Fox. That is, unless ABC/ESPN raked in a larger audience for its Raiders-Lions broadcast on Monday. Those final numbers aren't available yet, but this post will be updated when they are.\n\nFox's singleheader was the most-watched on any network this season and up 24% compared to last year's game window.\n\nThe Chargers bested the Bears on NBC's Sunday Night Football broadcast, which tallied about 16M viewers. That's a season-low for the network, but it's still third among viewers for Week 8, as of now.\n\nPrime Video's Thursday Night Football came in last this week with an audience of 11.2M for the Buccaneers-Bills. Amazon is still calling it a win though, since it's an increase of 12% over last year's comparable TNF game. It's also a 15% viewership increase over the previous week's TNF game.",

        "body": "BETHESDA, Md. (TND) -- People who own pressure cookers should be aware of this recall. It involves about 930,000 Insignia Multi-Function Pressure Cookers that pose a burn hazard.\n\nThe problem is the pressure cooker has incorrect volume markings on the inner pot. That can cause people to overfill the pot, which could lead to hot food and liquids being ejected when the pressure cooker is vented, using the quick release method, or opened while its contents are pressurized.\n\nBest Buy, where most of the pressure cookers were sold, has gotten 31 reports of the contents expelling under pressure, including 17 reports of burn injuries, some of them second-degree and severe burns.\n\nThe inner cooker pots are black with a non-stick coating and embossed markings indicating cup and liter measurements. The electric pressure cookers and inner cooker pots are six- and eight-quart capacity.\n\nThe pressure cookers being recalled have model numbers NS-MC60SS8, NS-MC60SS9, and NS-MC80SS9. There are also inner cooker pots sold separately as replacements with model numbers NS-MCRP6NS9 and NS-MCRP6SS9.\n\nThey were sold at Best Buy stores, and online through Best Buy and Amazon, from October 2017 through this past June, for between $50 and $120.\n\nThe Consumer Product Safety Commission says anyone with a recalled pressure cooker should stop using it and contact Best Buy by clicking here. Best Buy will replace the inner pot and floating locking valve for signaling pressure for free, for people who register online.\n\nSome other advice from the feds: Check that the inner pot is not filled beyond two-thirds capacity, that the lid is fully locked before starting pressure cooking, and that the floating locking valve has dropped before trying to open the lid.",

(WTVF) -- She's a country music legend and a fashion icon, and now Dolly Parton fans can get an up close look at some of custom clothing.\n\nA new exhibit at Lipscomb University is called \"Dolly Parton and the Makers: My Life in Rhinestones.\" It features 25 outfits from Parton's storied career. It also tells the stories of the designers behind the looks and their creative process.\n\nThe display is connected to a new book \"Behind the Seams: My Life in Rhinestones,\" which was released on Oct. 17.\n\nFans and friends packed the Beaman Library on the Lipscomb campus Friday evening for a preview of the event. It featured music from the Lipscomb University Chorale, and remarks from university president Candice McQueen and Nashville Mayor Freddie O'Connell.\n\n\"Tonight, we are honoring a person who may be the most beloved person in the entertainment industry,\" McQueen said. \"Her music has been the soundtrack of our lives, and her unique fashion sense has left an indelible mark on the world of style.\"\n\nParton participated in the official ribbon cutting, and guests were able to tour the exhibit. Parton said it was a trip down memory lane.\n\n\"I'm amazed at how much I've done, I really am,\" joked Parton. \"Someone says how does it feel to see all that? I think, 'Phew, that's a lot of living.'\"\n\nParton said her favorite item featured in the display is the dress she wore while singing \"He's Alive\" on the CMA Awards in 1989.\n\n\"I love that song,\" said Parton. \"I remember that moment I sang that song. It meant so much to me.\"\n\nIn addition to dozens of sparkly gowns, the exhibit features shoes and other accessories.\n\nThe exhibit opens on Oct. 31 and runs through Dec. 9. Tickets cost $25 and must be purchased ahead of time.

During the US Justice Department's hearing late on Monday, Pichai said that Google Search, Android and Chrome are not only good products, but are good for the Internet as a whole, reports The Verge. \"People use Android to build smartphones at prices as low as $30, and it's what has helped bring hundreds of millions of people online,\" said Pichai. X Value Declining? Elon Musk-Owned Platform Now Worth Less Than Half of USD 44 Billion He Paid To Takeover a Year Ago, Says Report.\n\nGoogle spent around $26.3 billion in 2021 to remain the default search engine in multiple browsers, phones and platforms. The figure came out during the US Justice Department's cross-examination of Google's search head, Prabhakar Raghavan, last week. At the beginning of Pichai's testimony, Google lawyer John Schmidtlein had him walk through his life and work history, from growing up in India to running one of the largest companies on the planet. Pichai joined Google in 2004, and Schmidtlein asked why he believed in the company.\n\n\"I saw the potential. I realised for the first time the internet would touch most of humanity and it was a once-in-a-generation opportunity,\" Pichai said. When the lawyers asked about Google's deal with Apple, Pichai said that \"we wanted to make sure that as we contemplate a long-term deal, the concept of default was preserved in a consistent way.\" Google was worried at the time that Apple might make a deal with, say, Amazon. Apple Introduces MacBook Pro and iMac With M3 Chips: From Specifications To Features and Price, Check Everything Here.\n\n\"Google also worried about Apple's new Suggestions feature in Safari, which would help users navigate directly for some queries rather than sending everyone to Google's results page,\" according to the report. In its latest quarterly earnings report, Google said that its Search and other advertising revenues of $44 billion were up 11 per cent, led again by growth in retail. YouTube advertising revenues of $8 billion in the quarter were up 12 per cent, driven by both brand advertising and direct response.",

        "body": "DES MOINES -- Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said this week she \"wholeheartedly\" supports the state's investigation into illegal sports betting by current and former University of Iowa and Iowa State student-athletes.\n\nHowever, the leader of the state commission that oversees gambling in Iowa, in a phone conversation with a parent of one of the student-athletes who was charged with tampering with records as part of the sports betting investigation, said \"a lot of people don't agree\" with how the state's investigation was handled, according to a transcript of the call in a court filing published this week.\n\nEarlier this year, 16 current and former UI and ISU student-athletes and other individuals were charged with placing illegal bets and tampering with records to conceal their involvement. At least five placed illegal bets on games in which they participated, according to charges filed by prosecutors.\n\nPeople are also reading...

She referred specific questions to the Iowa Department of Public Safety -- which houses the Division of Criminal Investigation -- but expressed strong support for the state's investigation.\n\n\"They did the job. They received inquiries about an issue and they did what they do. ... And I think they were surprised at some of the results that they found,\" Reynolds said. \"They don't check in with me, but I support wholeheartedly the department and the decisions that were made.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\nBut in a court filing published Wednesday, Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission Administrator Brian Ohorilko told one of the charged student-athletes' parents, according to a phone call transcript, that there may have been \"philosophical differences\" with the Division of Criminal Investigation.\n\n\"I have some strong feelings, but it wouldn't be appropriate for me to tell you. I do think there's maybe some philosophical differences in how this took place,\" Ohorilko told Brad Hanika, the father of Iowa State football player DeShawn Hanika, during a June 8 phone call, according to court documents.\n\nDuring two subsequent phone calls, Ohorilko also said to Brad Hanika on June 13, \"I don't know if everybody looks at it the same way that the DCI looks at it,\" and on Sept. 7, \"A lot of people don't agree with how things have been handled,\" according to the court filing.\n\nOhorilko, in a statement emailed to The Gazette Friday, said he regularly takes phone calls from the public in an effort to operate the commission with transparency and integrity.\n\n\"As Administrator, I take the Commission's mission of maintaining the integrity of gaming within the State of Iowa very seriously. I strive to be transparent with all who take interest in gaming related issues as I feel integrity and transparency go hand-in-hand,\" Ohorilko said. \"While I certainly do not condone breaking Iowa law, as a dad and coach, I was able to empathize with Mr. Hanika and his son's situation. The Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission did not request or conduct this investigation.\"\n\nThe charge against DeShawn Hanika -- tampering with records -- eventually was dismissed. The conversations between Ohorilko and Brad Hanika were filed by the attorney for former Iowa State football player Eyioma Uwazurike who still faces charges of identify theft, a class D felony, and tampering with records, an aggravated misdemeanor. The felony charge carries a punishment of up to five years in prison, and the misdemeanor is punishable by up to two years in jail. Uwazurike has pleaded not guilty.\n\nDuring her news conference this week, Reynolds added that she thinks more education is needed to ensure student-athletes fully understand the consequences of sports betting that violates state law or the rules that govern college athletics. She acknowledged that such education and information campaigns already exist, but said perhaps even more are needed.\n\n\"This is a wake-up call, too. We just have to do better education, make sure that these kids understand the consequences of doing this. This is preventable,\" Reynolds said. \"And I know they do, but we might need to (do more), just because it's so available and it's so easy. We really might need to double down on our efforts to make sure that they understand the consequences that are involved.\"\n\nSports betting fuels US gambling's record-breaking growth.

Their patented POD-System allows anyone to easily adjust their pillow to get the exact support they need and sleep better.\n\nThese discoveries have led to endorsements from leading spine experts such as Michael V. Halliday, founder of uprightspine.com. For him, the Twilla Adjustable Pillow \"checks all of the boxes\" that he's looking for in a pillow by allowing people to customize their pillow and appropriately support the head and neck, thereby putting the spine in an optimal position during sleep.\n\nDrawing on a combined 30-plus years of experience as designers for companies such as YETI, Lenovo, crankbrothers and Black Diamond, the pair began collaborating after seeing a problem with pillows on the market.\n\n\"Everyone sleeps, so we were frustrated that we could not find a good pillow for ourselves,\" Mark Rane told St. George News. \"As designers, the idea of recreating a product that's been around forever and changing the way people interact with it is really appealing.\"\n\n\"We know how to design great products and source the best materials,\" he added, \"so we were excited to finally design a product together from scratch, and under our own brand.\"\n\nThey developed both the idea and product through hundreds of prototypes.

The PODS can easily be added or positioned in any configuration for support and pain relief.\n\nSince they launched in 2022, Twilla has received great feedback from customers and has continued to grow.\n\nJay, an enthusiastic customer, said: \"I've never had a pillow I cared about before this one.

But even more than that, the quality just feels great!\"\n\n\"I've been in search for a good pillow forever, I finally found it! It's the perfect density and it stays cool.

        "body": "MOSCOW, Idaho -- It's been almost six months since a group of Latah County residents indicted the man accused of murdering four University of Idaho college students at an off-campus home. Now, his defense wants that group's decision thrown out.\n\nUltimately, that won't happen; at least not for the reasons presented during Thursday's public hearing.\n\nBryan Kohberger appeared in Latah County Court Thursday for a hearing on his motion to throw out his indictment on the grounds of \"error in grand jury instructions.\" The defense, state and judge argued about a precedent previously set by the Idaho Supreme Court. Ultimately, the judge said he couldn't do anything to change existing law and denied the motion.\n\nDefense attorney Jay Logsdon presented Kohberger's argument in court Thursday. He said grand juries are hard to control and will likely indict a suspect on their accused crimes. However, he added statutes were created to reign in grand juries and prevent prejudice against a suspect.\n\nLogsdon said the defense takes issue with the burden of proof presented to the grand jury. He argued the standard of proof for a grand jury is \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" rather than probable cause.\n\nJudge John Judge stepped in at this point in the hearing, stating it's not fair to claim the grand jury was given false instructions if those instructions are standard in Idaho. The state added the Idaho Supreme Court has held probable cause as its correct standard of proof for a grand jury.\n\nIt is essential to note an indictment does not mean a suspect is guilty; instead, it means the grand jury has determined there is enough evidence against the suspect to convict them of their accused crimes at trial.\n\nJudge John Judge told Logsdon that while his argument is \"creative,\" he can't change a law previously set by the Idaho Supreme Court. For that reason, he denied the defense's motion.\n\nThis is not the only motion to dismiss Kohberger's indictment, however. On Thursday morning, a private hearing was held to discuss the defense's claims the grand jury was biased and shown inadmissible evidence. The defense also claimed the grand jury was shown a lack of sufficient evidence and claimed the prosecution withheld exculpatory evidence.\n\nThe outcome of that hearing is under a seal and will not be released to the public.\n\nKohberger is accused of murdering Ethan Chapin, Kaylee Goncalves, Xana Kernodle and Madison Mogen in an off-campus home on Nov. 13, 2022. He was arrested at his parent's home in Pennsylvania on Dec. 30, 2022 and extradited back to Latah County in January. He's been in custody at the Latah County Jail ever since.\n\nFire TV: Search for \"KREM\" to find the free app to add to your account.

        "body": "ALBANY - The Office of the New York State Comptroller recently recognized Livingston County for the county's fiscal management after the comptroller's office issued its latest Fiscal Stress Monitoring System results. Livingston County ranked among the top overall governments in New York State and received a \"no designation\" of fiscal stress.\n\n\"Our fiscal stress early warning system identifies potential financial problems for local governments so they can take corrective action to avoid problems down the road,\" Comptroller Thomas J. DiNapoli said in a statement. \"The fact that fewer local governments were in fiscal stress in fiscal year 2022 was largely due to the infusion of aid from the American Rescue Plan Act and sales tax revenue growth. Sales tax collections have leveled off in recent months and federal dollars are being spent down, so localities should plan their budgets cautiously and accordingly.\"\n\nLivingston County's score of 3.3 resulted in \"no designation\" of fiscal stress from DiNapoli's Office marking the third time in the last four years that the county has achieved one of the State's highest classifications.\n\nScores are out of 100 and are determined using a variety of metrics. The score then correlates with one of four fiscal stress designations: significant, moderate, susceptible to and no designation. Higher scores indicate a higher level of fiscal stress.\n\nDiNapoli's report evaluates local governments on financial indicators including year-end fund balance, cash-on-hand, short-term borrowing, fixed costs and patterns of operating deficits to create fiscal stress scores for each municipality in the state.\n\n\"The latest Fiscal Stress Monitoring System results are a reminder that Livingston County continues to practice sound budgeting and financial responsibility,\" said Livingston County Administrator Ian M. Coyle. \"The County's Board of Supervisors, department heads and elected officials have developed responsible budgets that control spending. Our citizens expect their tax dollars to be spent wisely and efficiently and our score in the Comptroller's Fiscal Stress Monitoring System speak to those efforts.\n\nTo learn more about the fiscal stress scores or to view the scores for each reporting municipality, visit the Office of the New York State Comptroller's website at https://www.osc.state.ny.us/.\n\n.\n\nAs an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.",

        "body": "WORCESTER, WHITINSVILLE, Mass. -- Over 75 friends, family members and fans from both the Armenian and Worcester communities gathered to celebrate the release of Who She Left Behind, the debut novel by Victoria Atamian Waterman. The event, held at the Worcester Historical Museum, was hosted by Valerie and Steve Loring and Judy King, renowned philanthropists and cherished friends of the author.\n\nKicking off the event, King introduced her sister, Val Loring, a dedicated supporter of causes that empower women and girls in Worcester. It was through their shared commitment to these causes that they crossed paths and formed a close friendship with Victoria and her husband, Jim Waterman. Loring delivered a stirring and emotional introduction, emphasizing how the motto of a magnet she had left behind in Massachusetts when she moved to Maine aptly describes how Waterman has embraced opportunities and pursued her passions: \"Carpe Diem - Seize the Day!\"\n\nThe program took on a fireside chat format, skillfully guided by the author's longtime friend and colleague Alicia O'Connell Rogers, who serves as the youth librarian at Worcester Public Library. Their engaging conversation began with Rogers' inquiry about the book's themes and its portrayal of family. Waterman explained that the prologue and epilogue of the book are set in present-day North Burial Ground in Providence, Rhode Island, while the pages in between vividly recount the journey of her family's survival during the 1915 Armenian Genocide and their subsequent relocation to Massachusetts and Rhode Island to build new lives.\n\nWaterman then shared that her favorite part of the book is found in the very first chapter. She recounted how, as children, she and her cousins used to concoct plans to follow their grandmothers' instructions to uncover the treasures they had buried under a tree back in Gurin, Armenia, believing they would one day return. Waterman emphasized that burying gold and small valuables was a common practice among many Armenian families facing deportation in 1915, but her great-aunts' poignant treasures were the dolls they had hidden under the tree. A collective \"aww\" was heard through the room, and the author continued, explaining her deep-rooted intention to memorialize this touching memory. Throughout the book, she weaves a recurring theme of dolls and doll-making, crafting a meaningful thread that runs through the heart of the story.\n\nThe conversation then explored the significant connection between the Worcester Historical Museum and the vital role Worcester played in Armenian history. Waterman elaborated on how Worcester was home to the first Armenian church in the western hemisphere. She also highlighted the invaluable documents held in the museum's library, which are often challenging to locate elsewhere.\n\nWaterman spoke about her commitment to respectfully representing the historical context that supports the fictional characters in her novel. To achieve this, she conducted thorough research, digging into a wide range of scholarly works and resources. These included memoirs, history books, historical fiction, firsthand accounts, oral histories and more. She shared an example of her diligent efforts, noting her desire to depict a fictional friendship between her Aunt Vicky and Alice Stone Blackwell, a renowned feminist and humanitarian who brilliantly translated Armenian Poems. This translation was of immense significance and had strong ties to Worcester, as it played a pivotal role in raising funds for Armenian causes. Notably, Blackwell was the daughter of Lucy Stone, a leading reformer and advocate of women's rights, who spoke at the first National Woman's Rights Convention held in Worcester in 1850. Stone's portrait adorns the walls of historic Mechanics Hall in the city. Unfortunately, Aunt Vicky and Blackwell were not in Worcester in the same decade, and the fictional friendship ended there.\n\nWaterman then discussed how she infused her personal experiences from her career in girls' and women's leadership into her writing. In the initial stages of her writing journey, she grappled with uncertainty regarding the storyline and the message she wished to convey. However, as she searched for stories and narratives that demanded recognition, she experienced breakthrough moments that profoundly resonated with her. She discovered a disheartening truth -- that over 70-percent of historical accounts are authored by men and predominantly focus on male perspectives, leaving a significant gap in our understanding of history. She said it became crystal clear that she had a commitment to fulfill -- to tell a story that would pay tribute to the voices that had been overlooked for far too long. It was of paramount importance that she portrayed the stories of women as strong and resilient individuals rather than as powerless victims.\n\nThis sense of purpose became the driving force behind her writing and led her to become a student of Karen Jeppe and the Rescue Home of Aleppo, whose extraordinary heroism she incorporated into her narrative. Waterman holds Jeppe in the highest regard, describing her as a mission-driven leader who employed her business acumen and humanitarian spirit to rescue Armenian women trapped in horrifying circumstances and providing skills to empower self-sufficiency.\n\nThe conversation would have been incomplete without connecting the historical events in the story to current headlines. Waterman's tone turned somber as she discussed the recent developments, particularly the fall of Artsakh, which unfolded in a matter of weeks while the world watched in silence. Approximately 120,000 people were forcibly displaced by Azerbaijan following a 10-month blockade that prevented food and medical supplies from reaching severely malnourished individuals in desperate need. She expressed her frustration that this story has gone largely unnoticed in the news. She urged the audience to remain aware of the ongoing humanitarian crisis affecting Armenians worldwide and not to simply scroll past these mentions in their newsfeeds. Victoria emphasized the reality of generational trauma and the lasting impact it has on people, stating, \"Your Armenian friends are not okay.\"\n\nThe author also pointed out the recent events in the past week where terrorist groups, such as Hamas, invaded Israel, resulting in the tragic loss of thousands of lives, including barbaric acts against the Jewish and Palestinian communities.\n\nAs the session neared its conclusion, a lively Q&A unfolded, during which more of Waterman's remarkable research findings were revealed. Before wrapping up, Rogers posed a crucial question: How could the audience contribute to the success of the novel? According to Victoria's publisher, Historium Press, the initial 30 days following the book's release are pivotal to its success. To support her goal, she encouraged the audience to help her garner 50 favorable reviews on platforms like Amazon and Goodreads by November 16. These reviews need not be extensive; even a simple 5-star rating and some positive comments would be greatly appreciated if readers found the book deserving.\n\nWaterman also requested that people spread the word among their friends and networks and consider inviting her to participate in group meetings, book clubs, speaking engagements and other events. She emphasized that the book has much more to offer beyond its exploration of Armenian culture, and she welcomed opportunities to share these diverse facets with a wider audience.\n\nWhat lies ahead in the author's literary journey? She's already hard at work on her second book, which explores her grandfather's incredible story of survival and chronicles his upbringing in a Greek orphanage and the miraculous reunion with his father and cousin in Providence, Rhode Island.\n\nOn a lighter note, for those with connections in the film industry, Waterman wants to put in a good word that she envisions she and her husband being portrayed by Amal and George Clooney, though her husband humorously leans more toward the idea of Danny DeVito.\n\nThe guests enjoyed an elegant evening with celebratory spirits and Middle Eastern-inspired hors d'oeuvres artfully provided by Struck Catering. Eager readers lined up to purchase books from TidePool Bookshop and have them personally signed by the author. Special thanks for capturing the moments go to Kenneth Martin for the photographs and Craig Martin for the videography.\n\nThe congregation of the Armenian Church of Whitinsville, St. Asdvadzadzin Armenian Apostolic Church, gathered on the first Sunday of the book's release to participate in the book blessing service. Rev. Fr. Mikael Der Kosrofian and Deacons Raffi Samkiranian and Jeff Kalousdian officiated the service with the tradition of pouring Armenian red wine over the pages of the book while praying: \"Lord God, Omnipotent and Almighty, giver of all goodness and prosperity, you are a forgiving Lord, and we turn to you for strength. Guide Victoria to continue to be an example for women of all ages. Bless this book O Lord, Who She Left Behind, and inspire those who will read the untold stories of the brave and resilient women who became the pillars of reconstructed communities after the Armenian Genocide. Lord Jesus, from the abundance of your mercy, enrich Victoria and safeguard her. Inspire her to author new works. Strengthened by your blessings, may we always be thankful to you and bless you with unending joy, together with the Father and the Holy Spirit. Amen.\"\n\nFuture Book Signing Events in MA & RI:\n\nNov. 12, RI - Providence, by AHARI Armenian Historical Assoc. of RI\n\nNov. 13, RI - North Smithfield Public Library\n\nNov. 15, MA - TidePool Bookshop, Worcester\n\nNov. 18, MA - Tatnuck Bookseller, Westborough\n\nDec. 9, RI - Warwick Public Library\n\nDec. 12, MA - Watertown Public Library and Armenian Museum of America",

Anthropic agreed to use Amazon's chips to develop its next models and to use AWS for \"mission critical workloads.\"\n\nAmazon has already announced it aimed to soup up its Alexa voice assistant with generative AI, which the firm said would allow users to have smoother conversations.\n\nRetail rebound Amazon earnings \"soared past expectations\" in the quarter, according to Insider Intelligence analyst Zak Stambor.\n\n\"We had a strong third quarter as our cost to serve and speed of delivery in our stores business took another step forward,\" Jassy said, adding its ad business grew \"robustly\" and AWS cloud computing business \"continued to stabilize.\"\n\n\"The retail giant's slowdown last year appears to be in the rearview mirror as it has embarked on significant cost-cutting throughout this year and sharpened its focus on key growth areas, such as its high-margin online marketplace and advertising,\" Stambor said.\n\nA top US antitrust regulator sued Amazon in September, accusing the online retail behemoth of running an illegal monopoly by strong-arming sellers and stifling potential rivals.\n\n\"Our complaint lays out how Amazon has used a set of punitive and coercive tactics to unlawfully maintain its monopolies,\" said Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan.\n\nRobots and drones Amazon said on Thursday it will hire 250,000 full-time, part-time and seasonal employees in the United States to handle shopping demand in the months ahead.\n\nAmazon said last week that it will expand drone delivery of certain purchases to a third US state as well as to Britain and Italy by the end of 2024. The US firm has installed a new robotics system in one of its Texas logistics centers, featuring technology like automated vehicles, mechanical arms and computer vision technology.\n\nAmazon already uses 750,000 robots in its warehouses to speed up deliveries.\n\n\"The better they get at delivery, the more it continues to grow the e-commerce market overall and Amazon's place within that market,\" said Insider Intelligence analyst Andrew Lipsman.\n\nBut increased productivity via robots won't fix underlying Amazon worker issues, critics say.\n\nAmazon early this year eliminated some 27,000 jobs in a move it said at the time was necessary after years of sustained hiring.\n\nAds shine\n\nAdvertising continues to be \"a major bright spot\" for Amazon, and it has started using generative artificial intelligence to help sellers create \"eye-catching\" ads in its online marketplace, analyst Stambor said.\n\nInsider Intelligence expects Amazon US advertising business to bring in nearly $34 billion this year in a major leap from before the Covid-19 pandemic.",

(WPRI) -- The Rhode Island Department of Health is warning parents not to give their children WanaBana Apple Cinnamon Fruit Puree Pouches because they may contain elevated levels of lead.\n\nThe advisory includes all pouches of that type, no matter the expiration date.\n\nThe Health Department said they were sold nationwide, including by Amazon, Dollar Tree and Sam's Club.\n\nThe warning stems from an investigation in North Carolina. Health officials there found four children with elevated levels of lead in their blood and the fruit puree pouches were discovered to be a potential shared source of exposure.\n\nThe pouches were tested and found to contain \"extremely high concentrations of lead,\" according to the Health Department. A review from the FDA supported the findings.\n\nLead is toxic to humans and can affect people of any age or health status. While exposure is difficult to see, there are some symptoms to look out for.\n\nShort-term exposure to lead could cause headaches, abdominal pain/colic, vomiting and anemia.\n\nLonger-term exposure could result in these additional symptoms:\n\nThe Health Department said if there's suspicion that a child may have been exposed to lead, parents should talk to their health care provider about getting a blood test.",

(WTVF) -- There are plenty of options for a quiet escape at the Nashville Public Library, but the children's wing may not always be one of them.\n\n\"Maybe a typical child - the noise would not bother them, but for a child with sensory it's too loud, so they need it much lighter,\" said mother Mary Jackson.\n\nWhich is why the main branch is excited to reveal a new room.\n\n\"I love the ambiance in there, the lighting, it just has a real calm feeling about it,\" said Jackson. That feeling is key to this sensory room, a quiet place for children to soothe and self-regulate.\n\nMary Jackson helped create the room. Her 10-year-old son Carson has Autism, which is why she said places like this allow him to decompress. \"All kids have temper tantrums, or meltdowns if you want to call them,\" said Jackson. \"So it's a really great place to go to calm down, kind of go from A to B with your mental health and your space of emotion.\"\n\nThe manager of Children's Services at the library, Patricia Rua-Bashir, came up with the idea more than a year ago. She partnered with Jackson and Autism Tennessee to bring the room to life.\n\nRua-Bashir said, \"And so we want to be inclusive and serve autistic children, children with Down syndrome that have sensory needs.\"\n\nEvery item in the room was carefully curated with those children in mind.\n\n\"The truth is when we did this we want to make sure that autistic children and children with Down syndrome feel welcomed to the library,\" Rua-Bashir said.\n\nJackson hopes it opens the door to important conversations for all to enter.\n\n\"Try to understand and be supportive if you know somebody who has a child on the spectrum. Reach out to them because it is a very lonely path as a parent, and everyone wants to be heard, and everyone wants to feel accepted in this world,\" said Jackson. \"You never know how much you could change somebody's life by doing that.\"\n\nGet NewsChannel 5 Now, wherever, whenever, always free.

(WTVF) -- The previous airport authority board is being re-instated as a long battle between Metropolitan Nashville Airport Authority (MNAA) and Metro government on the makeup of the board continues.\n\nIn June, NewsChannel 5 reported on the state legislature's original decision to pass a bill remaking the airport authority. The bill broke down the board so that four people were appointed by the Speaker of the House, four people appointed by the Lt. Governor and two persons to be appointed by the governor and the mayor of the metropolitan government or the mayor's designee. Before this, the Nashville mayor appointed people to the board.\n\nNashville took the state to court over this change, but the state won. NewsChannel 5 reported on a judge ruling against Metro back in August, which made it so that members of the airport authority board are chosen by the governor and state lawmakers, not Metro. At the time, the judge ruled in MNAA's favor, explaining in the filing that Metro waited three weeks to move for the injunction, but they had known about the changes since Governor Lee signed the Act into law on May 19, 2023 and could have acted much sooner.\n\nHowever, with this new ruling, the appeals court overruled the state law, meaning the original board is re-instated.\n\nAccording to the ruling, \"the statutory makeup of the new Board and the expansion of powers afforded MNAA are unconstitutional, (therefore) we strike them from the Act.\"\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nThe ruling says the old board is being re-instated \"without the additional powers and responsibilities contained in Sections 6, 7, 8, and 9 of the Act.\"\n\nThese added sections allowed metropolitan airport authorities to do as follows:\n\nacquire property by eminent domain proceedingsmodify sections of a public \"street or other public way, ground, place or space, or public utility,\" as long as the authority owns the surrounding property regulate the aircraft hazards and things like land use that might impact the safety of airport operations\n\nAs long as the metropolitan airport authorities match section 2 of the Act's guidlines for population (at least 500,000) and government (must be of the metropolitan form), these new rules applied.\n\nHowever, these allowances are no longer present in the airport authority board, as the \"new board is vacated, and the old board is reinstated,\" according to the judge filing.\n\nAs it was designed, the airport oversees the Nashville International Airport. The board oversees the planning, construction, operation and management of BNA and John C. Tune Airport. The second is to assure the promotion, encouragement and development of commerce and industry through air transportation.\n\nGet NewsChannel 5 Now, wherever, whenever, always free.

She's the biggest thing going on this year and I'm like 'why didn't I even think of that?,\" said Eklof.\n\nThe clothing for the skeletons, featuring all ten Swift eras, was donated by her sister and purchased from Amazon and Goodwill.\n\n\"Unfortunately, my husband is a Bears fan, so I could not put a Travis Kelsey jersey in our yard,\" said Eklof.\n\nThe decorations are bringing in crowds from outside the neighborhood and have even racked up hundreds of likes on social media.\n\n\"I love the reaction we've had from our neighbors. Everyone loves it, it brings people so much joy. The amount of people that come and take pictures, the little kids in the neighborhood that just tell their parents they want to walk by every single day,\" said Eklof.\n\nPamela said the Swiftie skeletons are bringing happiness to those who need it.\n\n\"The thing I keep hearing over and over again is how much joy it brings to everyone,\" said Eklof.\n\nEklof said she's likely going to choose a different theme next year, but added the Eras theme will be hard to beat.",

In fact, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters just got a historic new contract with UPS.\n\n\"This is our time, this is our defining moment to get back what we haven't been getting in so long,\" said Janet Billingsley, UAW Local 674 president.\n\nThe 115 UAW workers in West Chester are getting ready to go back to work after the union and GM reached a tentative new deal Monday morning, which would bring an end to the strike against all three of the biggest automakers in the U.S. The tentative deal includes 25% raises, as well as cost of living adjustments.\n\nLast month, UAW President Shawn Fain spoke to members on the first day of the UAW strike.\n\n\"Class war has been going on for 40 years in this country,\" said Fain. \"The billionaire class has been taking everything and the working class has been left scraping paycheck to paycheck just trying to survive.\"\n\nOn Aug. 22, the Teamsters voted overwhelmingly to ratify the new contract with UPS. It includes full-time drivers making about $170,000 a year.\n\n\"There's just not as many people to work as there used to be,\" said Janet Harrah with NKU's Haile College of Business. \"I think, an impact of inflation, I think workers simply understand that money is not going as far as it used to be and to keep up, not make more, but keep up with the cost of living.\"\n\n\"I think the public shares this frustration, the sense that the gap between the wealthy and kind of regular people has grown way too wide,\" said Kate Bronfenbrenner with Cornell University's School of Industrial and Labor Relations. \"There's all this press about the economy is doing well, and there are tight labor markets, but they sure don't see it, they can't afford to buy a house, they're having a hard time making their car payment, sending their kids to college.\"\n\nBoth Harrah and Bronfenbrenner also point to other factors driving a growing labor movement. They include a middle class struggling and shrinking since the 1980s, rising inflation and unemployment currently at 3.8%. These factors could be the reasons why employees are gaining some leverage over their employers.\n\n\"As long as the economy continues to do well, there's a shortage of workers, the unionization efforts will continue,\" said Harrah.\n\n\"What has happened, is workers have a taste of what they can win, and a lot more workers are doing to try,\" said Bronfenbrenner.\n\nIn the latest Gallup poll, 67% of Americans approve of unions, after more than a decade of rising support. Union support reached an all-time low of 48% in 2009 after the Great Recession. It took eight years to recover to its prior level of 60%.\n\nHowever, union support has not reached 75%, which was an all-time high in the post-World War II era of the 1950s. That's when union membership peaked at about 35%.\n\nPew Research found about six in 10 adults say the large reduction over the past several decades in the percentage of workers who are represented by unions has been somewhat or very bad for the country. Union membership has fallen since 1983 when 20.1% of American workers were union members, compared to 2022, when only 10.1% belonged to a union.\n\nThere's also a labor movement from some non-union workers. Some pharmacists at CVS, Walgreens and Rite Aid started three-day walkouts, protesting what they call \"harsh working conditions.\" When these employees have done this in the past, it's resulted in some pharmacies temporarily closing, as well as slowing down business.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nWest Chester GM workers ready to return to work after tentative UAW agreement\n\nAmazon workers want a union at CVG.

        "body": "Washington -- Looks like former President Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama are putting down deeper roots in Washington. After renting a house for their post-White House stint in the nation's capital, the Obamas have purchased the eight-bedroom, nine-and-a-half-bath home for $8.1 million, according to property records.\n\nThe Obamas have said they plan to remain in Washington while their younger daughter, Sasha, finishes high school at Sidwell Friends. After leaving the executive mansion in January, the family settled into a rental home owned by Bill Clinton press secretary Joe Lockhart and his wife, Glamour editor Giovanna Gray Lockhart, an 8,200-square-foot home that was built in 1921 and renovated in 2011.\n\nThe Obamas still own a Georgian-style home in the Hyde Park neighborhood in Chicago, the city that will house the Obama presidential library.\n\nSpokesman Kevin Lewis, in a statement, said the purchase just made sense for the family: \"Given that President and Mrs. Obama will be in Washington for at least another 2 1/2 years, it made sense for them to buy a home rather than continuing to rent property.\"\n\nWashington records show that Lockhart sold the home for $8.1 million to Homefront Holdings LLC, which is controlled by the Obamas. The deed transfer was recorded on Wednesday. Lockhart bought the home in 2014 for $5.295 million, records show.\n\nThe $8.1 million purchase price makes the Obamas' new home the second-most expensive in the Kalorama neighborhood, behind the $23 million paid by Amazon founder (and Washington Post owner) Jeff Bezos for the former Textile Museum.\n\nThe Obamas have called the swanky Washington neighborhood (which they share with others, including first daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner) their home, but it has really functioned more like a home base for the globe-trotting family. The former first couple traveled to French Polynesia for an extended vacation after leaving the White House, and vacationed in Italy's Tuscany.",

        "body": "BRIGHTON PARK -- An hour before dismissal on a recent Friday afternoon, eight Brighton Park Elementary School students huddled in a classroom with Jennifer Moorhouse, a teacher who works with English language learners.\n\nThey were there for a voluntary, biweekly support group run by Moorhouse and Stephanie Carrillo, a school counselor, for students grappling with the upheaval of immigration and the adjustment to a new country, new city, and new school.\n\nShe asked the children -- a mix of sixth through eighth graders who had recently arrived in Chicago as part of an influx of migrant families -- to share the best and worst part of their week.\n\nOne boy said the best thing was that his family had moved to a new house. Another child looked up, her hair slightly covering her face. She shrugged her shoulders and struggled to come up with a worst moment.\n\nThat's OK, Moorhouse said in Spanish, she doesn't have to have a low point.\n\nThe girl then added, \"No mejor,\" meaning there was no high point either. After a moment of silence, the whole group burst into laughter.\n\nThese students, who arrived in Chicago between last year and this year, are among the more than 20,000 newly arrived migrants in Chicago since last August, with many fleeing from Central, South American and African countries experiencing political and economic turmoil, according to city officials.\n\nChicago Public Schools does not track immigration status and has not shared how many migrant students have enrolled in schools. But the district has pointed to clues of an increase, including 7,800 more English learners enrolled this school year, compared to an annual average increase of 3,000 such students.\n\nAs of mid-September, 2,250 migrant children were housed in the city's shelters, according to records from the city's Office of Emergency Management and Communications that were obtained by Chalkbeat.\n\nEducators have raised concerns that many Chicago schools don't have the resources, such as staff, to provide new migrants with the right language instruction, recently pleading with the state to send more help.\n\nBut there are also questions about whether newcomers have the social-emotional support they need at school. These students have potentially endured dangerous journeys to the United States, on top of the stress of leaving their homes behind for shelters or other temporary living arrangements in a foreign place.\n\nThat latter concern led Moorhouse to launch the support group at Brighton Park last year after she met a migrant student who was showing signs of trauma. The student, whom Moorhouse met in January, didn't want to be in school and sometimes, the student's body would shake uncontrollably, she said.\n\nAt one of the sessions Moorhouse held, the student shared a personal story about his journey to the United States. Afterward, Moorhouse recalled, the student said: \"My chest isn't hurting. I can breathe.\" Moorhouse felt it was a sign of healing.\n\nIn some ways, Brighton Park is well-positioned to host this support group. As a community school, it partners with a nonprofit organization to provide wraparound services for its students. Carrillo, the school counselor who helps Moorhouse with the support group, works with the school on behalf of its partner nonprofit, Brighton Park Neighborhood Council. Brighton Park Elementary's community schools funding also helped to pay for the training on the model that the support group is based on, according to Cecilia Mendoza, the school's assistant principal.\n\nThe model is known as STRONG, or Supporting Transition Resilience of Newcomer Groups, which focuses on teaching children how to understand and cope with their stress before they're invited to share more personal details about their journey to the United States, if they choose.\n\nIt's unclear how many schools have specific support groups for migrant students like the one at Brighton Park. About $35 million of the district's budget this year was allocated for social-emotional curriculum, behavioral health supports for students, and additional social workers and counselors, according to a district spokesperson.\n\nThis year, Moorhouse and Carrillo are starting with the basics.\n\nOn that recent Friday afternoon, in the classroom where Moorhouse gathered with eight of her students, bright orange and blue strips of paper on the dry erase board described concepts of melting and freezing in English and Spanish: \"Que le pasa al chocolate que se deja al sol?\" (What happens to chocolate left in the sun?).\n\nA plastic cupboard sat against the wall, filled with shoes, socks, and clothing donations Moorhouse had collected through her Amazon Wishlist. Sheets of paper taped to the wall have words of affirmation in both languages: \"Tus emociones son validas.\" (Your feelings are valid.)\n\nAfter their icebreaker, Moorhouse passed around crayons and a worksheet with the outline of a human body. She explained that stress can cause physical pain and asked her students to color in the part of their bodies that hurt when they are stressed.\n\n\"Entonces para mi, cuando yo estoy estresado, mi estómago me duele,\" she told the students, explaining that her stomach hurts when she's stressed.\n\nOne girl, wearing a pair of sneakers donated through the Amazon wishlist, used a green crayon to fill in the top of the head. She colored the shoulders with a green-yellow.\n\nWhen Moorhouse asked students to share, one boy said stress gives him a headache, and then he feels like throwing up. A low \"hmm\" spread through the group, as if others recognized the boy's feeling.\n\nAt 2:35 p.m., about halfway through the session, the students received a new worksheet. This one had a large triangle on it, and each point represented something different: pensamientos, sentimientos, y acciones. Thoughts, emotions, and actions. Moorhouse wanted the students to reflect on how a thought may lead to a feeling, which ultimately leads to an action.\n\nAfter a couple minutes jotting down their thoughts, the students shared their responses. One boy smiled as he described an example: When he's talking to other students and they suddenly begin speaking in English, he feels as if he's been removed from the conversation.\n\n\"How does that make you feel?\" Moorhouse asked him in Spanish.\n\nThat day, Mendoza, the assistant principal, was peeking in.\n\n\"I don't think students or people in general sometimes realize the effect that has on others who only speak one language,\" Mendoza said later. \"So that really stuck with me, and I thought about how we could have that conversation, perhaps, with the students ... because they might not be aware that they're doing that.\"\n\nMoorhouse then presented a challenge for the students: How can they change their thinking about a situation, in order to elicit better action? One boy gave the example of taking a hard math test that he doesn't know the answers to, so instead, he asks to go to the bathroom.\n\nHe was stumped when Moorhouse asked him to think of a better action. She opened the floor to the group, but no one came up with an answer good enough for Moorhouse. When she pressed them to think harder, they hit on a solution: He could ask the teacher for help -- for understanding the exam, or perhaps even asking to take it another day.\n\nWith about 15 minutes left, Moorhouse and Carillo passed around stress balls shaped like bee hives. They asked the students to squeeze hard and pretend that they were squeezing out the juice.\n\nA couple of kids laughed as they squeezed their fists and then released pressure.\n\nAround 2:55 p.m. Moorhouse handed out a blank calendar worksheet. For the following week, students would be expected to log how they've practiced relaxation strategies, such as grabbing an ice pack from the nurse or using a stress ball, when feeling stressed. One student shared that drawing helps.\n\nIt was time for dismissal. The students didn't run out the door. They stayed back to chat with each other. A few grabbed extra bags of Skinny Pop.\n\nAs the weeks go on, Moorhouse and Carrillo will meet individually with each student to assess whether they want to talk more about their personal experiences of coming to the U.S. and what would be appropriate to share with the other students.\n\nIn those conversations, students may show signs of needing more individual counseling provided by the school, such as bursting into tears while recounting a story, Carrillo said.\n\nSome students take a while to open up, so it's unclear how much they'll participate going forward, Moorhouse said. One of those quieter students is the child who had shared that there was no highlight or lowlight of her week. During the hourlong session, this student gradually opened up a little more.\n\nAnd when most of the other children left at the end of the day, that student stayed behind. She wanted to talk some more one-on-one with Moorhouse.\n\nReema Amin is a reporter covering Chicago Public Schools.

Taking care of yourself is something no one should be ashamed of.\n\nThat's the message the Ad Council and the Huntsman Mental Health Institute in Utah wants to spread with their 'Love your Mind' campaign.\n\n\"There's a mental health crisis in our country that has been laid bare by the challenges of the last several years: the COVID pandemic, economic uncertainty, and the ongoing movement for racial justice,\" said Lisa Sherman, president and CEO of the Ad Council. \"With the 'Love, Your Mind' campaign, we are offering people inspiration and actionable steps they can take to make their mental health a priority and experience how that benefits every area of their lives.\"\n\nThe PSA is putting a focus on men of color. The ad encourages Black and Hispanic men to get help instead of thinking they're taking on the world alone. The message of \"Love, Your Mind\" inspires individuals to nurture their relationship with their minds the same way they care for their closest personal relationships.\n\n\"People of color in our country frequently experience racial battle fatigue: a systemic racism-related repetitive stress injury that is strongly correlated with mental health challenges,\" said Dr. William A.

Produced by Nikos Frazier\n\nAmazon has created 2,100 jobs at its Papillion fulfillment center since opening in January, and the company's not done yet, officials said Thursday.\n\n\"On top of that, we will be likely to create an additional 500 jobs before the end of the year for our holiday season,\" said Sisi Hakam, senior operations manager at the plant.\n\nThe building opened Jan. 15 with approximately 300 employees.\n\nIn the building, employees pick, pack and ship customer orders such as books, toys and housewares.\n\nAmazon projects the facility will ship about 300,000 items a day during the holidays, Hakam said. That compares to 215,000 customer orders on an average day, the company says.\n\nPeople are also reading... Lincoln mall will get four new tenants.

Jim Pillen on Thursday morning toured the facility where humans, aided by 4,500 robots, pull product orders, box them and prepare them for shipment.\n\nPillen described the tour as \"absolutely incredible.\"\n\nThe building is an engineering marvel, full of scanners, chutes and miles of conveyors. The robots motor around the facility, guided by markings on the floor. They pull up to stations, where humans draw out the merchandise from a rack on top that resembles a portable clothes closet.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\nWorkers pack them in the signature Amazon brown cardboard boxes.\n\nThe building's footprint is 700,000 square feet. It contains more than a million square feet of storage, equivalent to 20 football fields.\n\nPillen thanked Amazon for investing in Nebraska, saying the company provides retail businesses with \"connectivity all over the world.\"\n\n\"We have incredible entrepreneurs and risk-takers and small businesses,\" Pillen said. \"They're the bread and butter of our communities. They're the bread and butter of Nebraska. And Amazon connects us and allows us to sell our goods, not only in our main streets but everywhere in the world.\"\n\nAccording to Amazon, more than 1,500 independent Nebraska sellers, most of which are small and medium-sized businesses, sell on Amazon.\n\nAfter touring the high-tech plant, Pillen said people should embrace technology and innovation, not fear it. Technology \"enhances careers,\" he said.\n\nAmazon officials emphasized they are hiring -- the current starting wage $17.75 an hour.\n\nAlso Thursday, Amazon announced it was donating $15,000 to the Papillion La Vista Community Schools Foundation to buy Orff musical instruments for elementary schools.\n\nOrff instruments, such as a xylophone, are good for learning because it's easy for a young student to make a good sound.\n\n\"Our teachers use Orff instruments that allow students to learn to read music, and this will allow us to replace them and also expand the number that we have,\" said Shureen Seery, assistant superintendent of curriculum at Papillion La Vista Community Schools.\n\nPhotos: Gov.

It is called Safe Streets and Roads for All (SS4A), and it includes pedestrians, cyclists, public transit riders and motorists, according to Clarksville Mayor Joe Pitts.\n\nHow will it work?\n\nThe SS4A Safety Action Plan will first locate a number of risk factors related to injuries and transportation fatalities, such as speeding, impaired driving, unsafe road infrastructure and distracted driving.\n\nThere is opportunity for citizens to get involved as well, with a brief, five-minute survey.\n\nThen, once the first draft of the Action Plan is complete, the city of Clarksville will be able to apply for implementation of capital construction grant funds through the federal discretionary grant program.\n\nWhen is it expected to be complete?\n\nThe Safety Plan is being funded by a grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration. It is expected to be complete by the Summer of 2024.\n\nOnce complete, there will be opportunities for the public to review and make comments both online and during in-person meetings.\n\nWhy is the plan in place?\n\n\"The objective of the Safety Action Plan is to provide specific projects for creating safer transportation in our community, reviewing our policies to ensure safety is an underlying theme in all that we do, and ultimately to strive towards Vision Zero, a mission to eliminate severe injuries and fatalities related to transportation,\" Mayor Pitts said. \"To provide the most benefit to the community and to understand the priorities of our public, it is imperative that we hear from the citizens and traveling public that use the City's transportation facilities every day whether that be a public street, sidewalk, bike lane, or the Clarksville Transit System.\"\n\nGet NewsChannel 5 Now, wherever, whenever, always free.

This comes as some law enforcement agencies are making changes to their vehicle pursuit protocols.\n\n29-year-old Bryson McClure is charged with capital murder, evading arrest, and unauthorized use of a vehicle. He is accused of crashing into a woman's SUV while fleeing from the Harris County Sheriff's Office on Friday. The woman, 57-year-old Lynette Winchester, was killed in the crash.\n\nSUGGESTED: Toddler killed in crash caused by altercation between driver and intoxicated passenger inside car\n\nThe Harris County Sheriff's Office said McClure was driving a stolen truck and ran a red light before slamming into Winchester's car at the intersection of Highway 249 and the Grand Parkway.\n\nDuring Monday's hearing, the judge set McClure's bond at $450,000.\n\nFOX 26 Houston is now on the FOX LOCAL app available through Apple TV, Amazon FireTV, Roku and Google Android TV!\n\nWhile this crash involved the Harris County Sheriff's Office, other law enforcement agencies have dealt with similar issues, including the Houston Police Department. HPD recently rolled out its new car chase policy that prohibits officers from pursing suspects for certain offenses.\n\n\"We will now prohibit pursuits when the only possible offense is a Class C, also a traffic or misdemeanor warrant, or a non-violent misdemeanor warrant,\" said Chief Troy Finner, of the Houston Police Department.\n\nIn the 30 days since the new policy has been enacted, HPD is reporting a 40% decrease in vehicle pursuits and a 35% decrease in collisions resulting from police chases.\n\nFOX 26 Houston reached out to the Harris County Sheriff's Office to find out if they have any intentions on implementing a \"no chase policy.\" The HCSO responded saying they are \"continually reviewing policies and operational processes to ensure the safety of those who serve and those we protect.\"",

We believe that the current climate in Gaza falls on the shoulders of the Israeli government, and no one else.\"\n\nDaoud led demonstrators in chants of \"resistance is justified when people are occupied.\"\n\nHinson responded on social media, posting: \"Hamas terrorists murdered Israeli families, raped women & dragged their bodies through the streets, killed 30 Americans & are still holding more hostage.\"\n\n\"Slaughtering entire families isn't 'resistance',\" Hinson wrote in another post. \"Murdering babies and raping women isn't 'resistance.' Terrorism isn't 'resistance.'\"\n\nHinson, talking to reporters, said \"freedom of speech is a cornerstone of our nation, but coordinated activities supporting Hamas and intimidating and endangering other citizens have no place in our lawful society.\"\n\nDaoud, in a video posted to social media site X, formerly Twitter, said Saturday's event was intended to mourn lives lost in Palestine, and that condemnation of rallies in support of Palestine ignores atrocities committed by Israeli forces against the Palestinian people over the decades.\n\n\"The killing of over 4,500 Palestinians will never be justified with the attempt of finding Hamas soldiers,\" Daoud said in the video, noting Israel had helped the creation of Hamas as a counter to Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) during 1980s.\n\nErnst's letter, with Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, cites examples of antisemitism on college campuses since the Oct. 7 attacks.\n\n\"We are significantly concerned that your Department is not ensuring American universities are fostering a safe learning environment for all students after the terrorist organization Hamas' violent attack on civilians, including Americans and Israeli citizens,\" says the letter to the U.S. Department of Education. \"Therefore, we write to urgently understand what the Department of Education is doing to enforce Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and ensure Jewish or Israeli college and university students are not subjected to discrimination based on race, color or national origin.\"\n\nErnst's office noted that she has signed off on proposed legislation from South Carolina U.S. Sen. Tim Scott, a Republican candidate for president, that would cut federal funding to any college or university that \"excuses or encourages anti-Semitism.\"\n\nIowa donating protective equipment to Israel\n\nIowa will donate to Israel more than 200 pallets of what Gov.

It's a part of a nationwide movement where many of them are begging hospitals for help with key decisions in the abortion conversation.\n\nThis week State Senator Heidi Campbell raised the question to Governor Bill Lee and Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti of what is being done to support both doctors and women during this time.\n\nDr. Katrina Green, an emergency medicine specialist here in Nashville says Tennessee has lost doctors in the confusion of post Roe v. Wade and she's concerned that it can get much worse.\n\nBoth comments are in response to a new Washington Post analysis on the nationwide issue. Critics say hospitals have failed to provide specific guidance or policies to help doctors navigate high-stakes decisions over how to interpret new abortion bans -- leading to situations where patients are denied care until they are on the brink of permanent injury or death.\n\nThey also mentioned that doctors are making life-or-death decisions at great personal risk, and hospital administrators are trying to figure out untested legal terrain and political pressure from lawmakers, and fears of losing funding.\n\nTennessee is on a list of 25 states where all post-Roe abortion bans in effect include medical exceptions. The exceptions are different, but Tennessee and Kentucky use language like \"to avert the death of a pregnant woman or to prevent serious risk of a substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\"\n\nDue to numerous cases of serious injury, this has caused debate in state legislatures across the country, several high-profile lawsuits and a standoff with Biden administration officials who say the procedure should be covered by emergency care laws.\n\nMedical professionals say something must be done before more lives and more doctors are gone in Tennessee.\n\nGet NewsChannel 5 Now, wherever, whenever, always free.

        "body": "LEWISTON, Maine -- The search for suspect Robert Card, 40, of Bowdoin, continues Friday after 18 people were killed in shootings at a restaurant and a bowling alley in Lewiston on Wednesday night.. Late Thursday, heavily armed law enforcement backed by a police helicopter had surrounded a home and told anyone who might be inside to surrender, but authorities eventually left without indicating anyone had been taken into custody.\n\nCard is considered to be armed and dangerous, according to police, and members of the public are advised to not approach him or make any contact. An arrest warrant charging Card with eight counts of murder has been issued, and state police said that number would likely rise to 18 as more of the victims are identified.\n\nMore than 350 law enforcement officials are involved in the search for Card, according to state police. The search is a coordinated effort between federal, state and local law enforcement.\n\nA shelter-in-place has been issued for all of Androscoggin County, as well as the town of Bowdoin, which is in Sagadahoc County. People in those areas are asked to stay inside and off the roads until further notice.\n\nState police are scheduled to provide updates during a press conference at Lewiston City Hall at 10 a.m. Friday. NEWS CENTER Maine will stream the press conference live on our website, YouTube, Amazon/Roku, and TV.\n\nWHAT TO KNOW\n\nLEWISTON SCHOOLS CLOSED FRIDAY, SUPERINTENDENT SAYS\n\nLewiston Public Schools will be closed again on Friday, according to a post by Superintendent Jake Langlais on the district's website.\n\n\"We remain in a shelter in place situation,\" the post said. \"We will not open buildings or run bus transportation.\"\n\nThe superintendent said students and staff have been directly impacted by the shooting and the events since 7 p.m. Wednesday are \"unimaginable.\"\n\nPortland Public Schools also remain closed Friday, according to a post on the district's website. MSAD 75 schools, which include the towns of Bowdoin, Bowdoinham, Topsham, and Harpswell, are also closed.\n\nBates College in Lewiston also canceled classes Friday and postponed the inauguration of the school's first Black president, Garry Jenkins, the school's website said.\n\nOFFICERS LEAVE HOME IN BOWDOIN, SAYING THEY WERE EXECUTING A SEARCH WARRANT\n\nMost of the law enforcement officers and a helicopter that surrounded a home connected to a relative of the suspect in the Maine shootings have left after executing a search warrant and calling for anyone inside to surrender.\n\nOfficers had yelled through a megaphone at the home near Bowdoin for Card or anyone inside to \"Come out with your hands up.\"\n\nMaine State Police said afterward that the announcements were standard.\n\n\"It is unknown whether Robert Card is in any of the homes law enforcement will search,\" the statement posted on Facebook said.\n\nRichard Goddard, who lives on the road where the searches were taking place in Bowdoin, said he knows the Card family and that Robert knows the terrain well.\n\n\"This is is his stomping ground. He grew up here. He knows every ledge to hide behind, every thicket,\" he said.\n\nREMEMBERING THE VICTIMS\n\nFamily and friends of the people who died in a mass shooting at two locations in Lewiston are beginning to share the names of their loved ones.\n\nNEWS CENTER Maine has spoken with family and friends of those who have died, and the following names have been shared with us so far, as of Thursday night:\n\nThe identities of the victims remain unconfirmed by law enforcement and medical officials.\n\nCANADA WARNS BORDER AGENTS TO BE ON LOOKOUT FOR MAINE SUSPECT\n\nThe Canada Border Services Agency has issued an \"armed and dangerous\" alert to its officers stationed along the Canada-U.S. border, warning them to be on the lookout for the man suspected of fatally shooting at least 18 people in southern Maine.\n\nThe shootings were reported Wednesday night in Lewiston, about 260 kilometers (161 miles) southwest of the New Brunswick border. As a massive search continued Thursday for suspect Robert Card, residents of southern Maine were told to lock their doors and remain inside.\n\nThe CBSA says it is working with Canadian and U.S. law enforcement partners, including U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to \"protect Canada's borders against any threat or attempt at illegal entry.\"\n\nThe Canadian border agency said that all entry points along the Canada-U.S. border remain open.\n\nMAINE LAWMAKERS VOW TO ENSURE SIMILAR TRAGEDY WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN\n\nState lawmakers in Maine, which has one of the country's lowest homicide rates, called the mass shootings that killed at least 18 people a tragedy and urged unity in the face of crisis.\n\nState Rep. Mana Abdi of Lewiston, the first Somali American elected to the Maine Legislature, and fellow Democratic Reps. Margaret Craven and Michel Lajoie said in a joint statement that they were \"committed to ensuring that a tragedy like this will never happen to another community ever again.\"\n\n\"We are deeply thankful to all of the first responders, law enforcement and hospital staff who responded swiftly, and will continue to keep all of our neighbors, families and friends who have been affected in our hearts,\" they said.\n\nRepublican state Rep. Laurel Libby, who represents nearby Auburn, said the community was in shock and the loss the state is facing is \"just unfathomable.\" Libby also said this was not the time to talk about the state's gun culture.\n\n\"We're already seeing our community really rallying together in support. I know that same spirit will carry us on through, but it's really not a time for guessing at motives at this point and pointing fingers,\" Libby said.\n\nBIDEN URGES RESIDENTS IN SEARCH AREA TO HEED LAW ENFORCEMENT WARNINGS\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Thursday urged residents of the area where police are searching for the suspect to heed the warning of local law enforcement.\n\n\"For countless Americans who have survived gun violence and been traumatized by it, a shooting such as this reopens deep and painful wounds,\" he said in a statement, adding that he and first lady Jill Biden were praying for the families of the victims. \"Far too many Americans have now had a family member killed or injured as a result of gun violence. That is not normal, and we cannot accept it.\"\n\nBiden once again called for the passage of a ban of so-called assault weapons. The president also ordered flags at half-staff to honor the victims of the shooting.\n\nOFFICIAL: POLICE TOOK SUSPECT FOR EVALUATION AFTER ERRATIC BEHAVIOR IN JULY\n\nA U.S. Army reservist suspected of killing at least 18 people in Maine had been taken by police for an evaluation after military officials became concerned that he was acting erratically in mid-July, a U.S. official told The Associated Press.\n\nThe official said commanders in the Army Reserve's 3rd Battalion, 304th Infantry Regiment became concerned in mid-July that Robert Card was acting erratically while the unit was training at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in New York.\n\nThe official said military commanders became concerned about Card's safety and asked for the police to be called. New York state police took Card to the Keller Army Community Hospital at West Point for evaluation, the official said.\n\nThe official was not authorized to publicly discuss information about the incident and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.\n\nARREST WARRANT ISSUED FOR SUSPECT IN MAINE SHOOTING\n\nAn arrest warrant for eight counts of murder has been issued for the suspect in the shootings at a Maine bowling alley and a restaurant, according to state police.\n\nAs more victims are identified, the counts against suspect Robert Card will probably grow to 18, Maine State Police Col. William Ross said.\n\nPolice responded to a \"very fast moving, very dangerous scene,\" Ross said, noting that seven people were found dead at the bowling alley and eight at the bar, including one victim who was outside. All had gunshot wounds. Three people who were taken to hospitals also died, Ross said.",

        "body": "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. military launched airstrikes early Friday on two locations in eastern Syria linked to Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, the Pentagon said, in retaliation for a slew of drone and missile attacks against U.S. bases and personnel in the region that began early last week.\n\nThe U.S. strikes reflect the Biden administration's determination to maintain a delicate balance. The U.S. wants to hit Iranian-backed groups suspected of targeting the U.S. as strongly as possible to deter future aggression, possibly fueled by Israel's war against Hamas, while also working to avoid inflaming the region and provoking a wider conflict.\n\nAccording to the Pentagon, there have been at least 12 attacks on U.S. bases and personnel in Iraq and four in Syria since Oct. 17. Air Force Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said 21 U.S. personnel were injured in two of those assaults that used drones to target al-Asad Airbase in Iraq and al-Tanf Garrison in Syria.\n\nPeople are also reading...

(WTVF) -- It's Halloween, and you may be reaching for some candy...many which contain nuts.\n\nThey're ingredients you may have never been allergic to before, but adult-onset food allergies are becoming more common.\n\nA 2019 study in 'JAMA Network Open' found more than 26-million American adults are food allergic and about half developed their allergy in adulthood.\n\nFrom 2007 to 2016 insurance claims for anaphylactic reactions to food rose 377% with a third of claims filed by adults.\n\nThat's according to non-profit 'Fair Health'. Here's how adult-onset food allergies can happen.\n\n\"So our immune system is always in flux. It is always surveying the outside world, looking for potential danger, and it is not uncommon for our immune system to occasionally get it wrong and see the outside world as a danger signal inappropriately, and that is allergy,\" said allergist and immunologist Dr. Kara Wada.\n\nDoctors say it's important to differentiate this from a food intolerance, which is also common for adults to develop.\n\nBut, accidentally eating a food you're intolerant to can mean an upset stomach, versus one you're allergic to that can require immediate medical attention.\n\nSigns of an allergy include itching, skin rashes or hives, nausea, wheezing and losing consciousness.\n\nIn addition to the nuts that may be in your Halloween candy, doctors say shellfish, milk, and fin fish are also top foods for adults to become allergic to later in life.\n\nIf you think this has happened to you, talk to your doctor about an allergy test.\n\nGet NewsChannel 5 Now, wherever, whenever, always free.

The national rate for that time frame was 11.2%.\n\nThe Piggly Wiggly on Dickerson Pike says their own experiences have taught them about food insecurity in the community.\n\nThe owner and staff's own experiences have shaped the business.\n\nThe grocery store is one of only a few in town where families can buy five filling food items for $19.99. It's the Pick 5 deal.\n\n\"Every store in Nashville has went above that instead of three stores, and we're one of those stores because that helps people build meals,\" said Freddie Robertson, the owner of Piggly Wiggly on Dickerson Pike.\n\nAlso, at the grocery store, temporary price reductions are another way they help customers, especially those receiving food assistance.\n\n\"It's very important to us to feed the community, to help them prepare their meals and stretch their benefits as far as they can. That's what we're about, and that's what we'll always be about,\" Robertson said.\n\nA contributing factor to food insecurity locally was the end of pandemic-era support programs. Those phased out just as food and utility prices started to soar last year.\n\nGet NewsChannel 5 Now, wherever, whenever, always free.

        "body": "DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors and the United Auto Workers union reach a tentative contract agreement, according to an AP source.\n\nThe deal follows the pattern set with Ford last week and Jeep maker Stellantis over the weekend.\n\nThose deals will last four years and eight months and include 25% general pay raises and cost of living adjustments. Combined they bring the wage increase to over 30% over the four year and eight month life of the contract.\n\nThe person briefed on the matter, who didn't want to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly aid the deal, was to be announced early Monday.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nDETROIT (AP) -- Pressure is rising on General Motors as the lone holdout in a strike targeting all three big Detroit automakers after a tentative contract agreement with Jeep maker Stellantis was reached with the United Auto Workers union over the weekend.\n\nThe UAW reached a tentative agreement last week with Ford and it wasted no time in hitting GM where it hurts financially as the strike enters its seventh week.\n\nNearly 4,000 unionized workers on Saturday walked out of GM's largest North American plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee, hours after the deal with Stellantis was announced. They join about 14,000 GM workers already striking at factories in Texas, Michigan and Missouri.\n\nSpring Hill produces the engines for vehicles assembled at nine plants as far afield as Mexico, including Silverado and Sierra pickups. It's a big money maker for GM that amplifies the company's financial pain after workers walked off the job last week in Arlington, Texas, where full-size SUVs including the Tahoe and Suburban are produced. Vehicles assembled at the Spring Hill plant now joining the strike include the electric Cadillac Lyriq, GMC Acadia and Cadillac crossover SUVs.\n\n\"The Spring Hill walkout affects so much of GM's production that the company is likely to settle quickly or close down most production,\" said Erik Gordon, a University of Michigan business professor. The union wants to wrap negotiations with all three automakers so \"Ford and Stellantis workers don't vote down (their) tentative agreements because they want to see what GM workers get.\"\n\nThe Stellantis deal mirrors one reached last week with Ford, and saves jobs at several plants, the UAW said.\n\nPresidents of the Ford union locals voted unanimously in Detroit on Sunday to endorse that tentative contract after UAW President Shawn Fain explained its details, the union tweeted.\n\nAs he explained the particulars to the full membership in a later livestream, Fain, along with Chuck Browning, the UAW vice president, said the deal represents a \"historical inflection point\" for reviving union power in an America where \"we were being left behind by an economy that only works for the billionaire class.\"\n\n\"UAW members at Ford will receive more in straight general wage increases over the next 4 1/2 years than we have over the last 22 years combined,\" Browning said.\n\nFain called the deal \"a turning point in the class war that has been raging in this country for the past 40 years.\"\n\nThe Ford and Stellantis pacts, which would run until April 30, 2028, include 25% in general wage increases for top assembly plant workers, with 11% coming once the deal is ratified.\n\nThe Ford agreement revives cost-of-living adjustments that the UAW agreed to suspend in 2009 during the Great Recession.\n\nTalks continued over the weekend with GM.\n\nAt Stellantis, workers get cost-of-living pay that would bring raises to a compounded 33%, with top assembly plant workers making more than $42 per hour. Top-scale workers there now make around $31 per hour.\n\nGordon, the University of Michigan professor, said the Stellantis deal \"shows that the car companies feel they are at the mercy of the UAW, that the UAW is not going to give any mercy.\"\n\nStarting wages for new Stellantis hires will rise 67% including cost-of-living adjustments to over $30 per hour. Temporary workers will get raises of more than 165%, while workers at parts centers will get an immediate 76% increase if the contract is ratified.\n\nLike the Ford agreement, it will take just three years for new workers to get to the top of the assembly pay scale, the union said. Similarly, the union won the right to strike over plant closures.\n\nBruce Baumhower, president of the local union at a large Stellantis Jeep factory in Toledo, Ohio, that had been on strike since September, said he expected workers to vote to approve the deal because of pay raises including the immediate 11% raise on ratification. \"It's a historic agreement as far as I'm concerned.\"\n\nStellantis is not out of the woods, however.\n\nOvernight, 8,200 Stellantis workers in Canada represented by a different union, Unifor, walked off the job. General Motors workers in Canada have already voted to ratify a three-year contract agreement with the company.\n\n\"Negotiations between Unifor and Stellantis continue with progress being made. Stay tuned for further updates,\" Unifor said in a prepared statement.\n\nThe UAW began targeted strikes against all three automakers on Sept. 15 after its contracts with the companies expired. At the peak, about 46,000 UAW workers were on strike -- about one-third of the union's 146,000 members at all three companies.\n\nShares of major automakers were flat before the opening bell Monday.\n\nGet NewsChannel 5 Now, wherever, whenever, always free.

But as unpleasant as it can be, following some basic common-sense rules can lessen the stress.\n\nSo, with holiday travel coming up, Consumer Reports unpacks the dos and don'ts of flying etiquette that could make your next trip - and everyone else's - more pleasant.\n\nFlight delays, long security checks and jam-packed planes make flying hard enough! Add in rude, inconsiderate passengers, and it's a recipe for disaster.\n\nBut being courteous can mean different things to different people.\n\n\"One time I did see someone giving themselves a manicure and that was a little too far for me,\" said one passenger.\n\nTo clear the air, Consumer Reports consulted with flight attendants and etiquette experts to come up with an essential guide of unspoken rules.\n\nTo begin - Middle seat passengers should have access to both armrests.\n\n\"It's the only real estate they own so let them get the consolation prize!\" Consumer Reports Margot Gilman.\n\nAnd what about reclining? You certainly have the right to, but before you do...\n\n\"Make sure you're not inconveniencing the person behind you, who may be tall. You can also politely ask if they mind if you recline,\" Gilman said.\n\nRemember you're sharing a confined space with others. That means don't hoard the overhead bins, wear headphones when using devices, avoid unpacking anything smelly like pungent food, so no tuna salad sandwiches, and definitely, definitely keep your shoes on!\n\n\"Because it stinks.\"\n\nAnd what if a person wants to switch seats? Or if someone is kicking your chair?\n\n\"It's ok to politely ask them to stop. And it's ok to say no to switching seats, if there's a reason you chose that seat - like a window so you can sleep. But be flexible if it's an equal trade - say an aisle seat one row back.\"\n\nAbove all...\n\n\"It doesn't do any good to get upset or angry or cause a disruption. The more relaxed you are, the better your flights are going to be.\"\n\nA good rule for many situations in the air, and on the ground.\n\nIf disruptions do occur - someone gets angry or aggressive - Consumer Reports says it's best not to take matters in your own hands.

Paxton allegedly promoted a McKinney technology company's stock without disclosing that he received compensation for doing so. Paxton has maintained his innocence throughout this legal ordeal.\n\nFOX 26 Houston is now on the FOX LOCAL app available through Apple TV, Amazon FireTV, Roku and Google Android TV!\n\nPretrial disputes, including the choice of venue, contributed to the lengthy trial delay. Initially, the case began in Paxton's hometown in Collin County but was moved to Harris County following the prosecution's recommendation.\n\nPaxton faces serious charges, including two counts of securities fraud, a first-degree felony carrying a potential sentence of up to 99 years in prison, and one count of failing to register with state securities regulators, a third-degree felony with a maximum punishment of 10 years behind bars.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX 26 NEWS APP\n\nThis trial is separate from Paxton's recent acquittal in a Senate impeachment trial. This trial focused on allegations of bribery and misconduct raised by former high-ranking officials in his office.\n\nEven though the impeachment articles initially included charges related to the securities case, they were set aside for a separate trial and dismissed.\n\nRELATED: Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton appears in Houston court hearing for his securities fraud trial\n\nThe upcoming securities fraud trial reminds Paxton that he still faces significant legal jeopardy despite his political triumph in the Senate.\n\nAdditionally, he remains under federal investigation for allegations made by former staffers.",

        "body": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WTVF) -- A Hermitage wife is suing the Metro Nashville government and one of its police officers directly after a domestic violence report resulted in the death of her husband, who she claims never had a gun pointed at police.\n\nPolice officials said officers fired on Mark Capps -- a 54-year-old armed man -- who was wanted on two counts of aggravated assault and aggravated kidnapping warrants involving his wife and stepdaughter. They fled the home this morning, police said. NewsChannel 5 learned Capps was a well-known music engineer. Capps worked with Alabama, Ronnie Milsap, Shenandoah, Amy Grant, Brooks & Dunn, Blake Shelton, Big & Rich, and other big names according to his discography.\n\nWatch the coverage of the shooting in the player above.\n\nCapps' wife, Tara, is suing the Metro government and officer Ashley Coon, with MNPD.\n\nThe lawsuit described Capps as having an \"acute mental health and substance abuse episode\" in his home. Capps' behavior affected\n\nthree members of his family: his wife Tara, Tara's daughter and her daughter's boyfriend, who worked for the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation.\n\nIn the video, officers shoot through the screen-glassed door at Capps after they ask him to show his hands. It takes less than a handful of seconds for officers to shoot Capps and kill him.\n\nHow police found out about the situation\n\nCapps started threatening his wife and stepdaughter at 3 a.m. The two were awakened and brought to the family room at gunpoint, according to police.\n\nCapps was throwing things about their home and threatening the two with the gun and not letting them leave. After sunup, Capps fell asleep. The two victims fled the residence and went to the Hermitage precinct. Officers took statements in detail and placed warrants against Capps. The warrants were issued around 1:55 p.m. when the police SWAT team was alerted of the situation and his access to firearms.\n\n\"Mrs. Capps asked if MNPD would shoot Capps if he were to pull a gun when they came to the house,\" the lawsuit stated. (MNPD) responded: 'It doesn't happen like that... in the last couple months I've had at least two people want to commit suicide by cop and both of them lived and both of them went to jail.'\"\n\nThe suit continues that 13 SWAT officers were called to the home. The suit said the team started setting up a breaching situation, without trying to contact Capps by phone prior to knocking on his.\n\n\"Ostensibly, MNPD's plan was for the two SWAT teams to withdraw to cover after setting the breaching charges and then attempt to talk to Capps. However, the SWAT team would end up killing Capps without ever attempting dialogue,\" the lawsuit stated. \"The SWAT officers did not find a gun Capps's hands, in his clothing, or on his body, and said absolutely nothing about a gun while they were restraining and moving him. The only gun found near Capps, a pistol, was tucked halfway under a rug on the other side of the entryway from him, several feet away.\"\n\nWhat's happened since\n\nAll the officers in this case were cleared to go back to duty, according to Metro Nashville Police Department officials in early October.\n\nThe officer who shot him Coon's personnel file, obtained by NewsChannel 5, shows a history of use of force and eight suspensions.\n\nIn one case in 2012, Coon was attempting to do a knock and talk with a neighbor. No one was answering the door, but eventually, a man came outside pointing a gun at officers. He was told to drop the weapon, and he did so. Officer Coon then grabbed the man and pulled him out of his home and handcuffed him. He then conducted a protective sweep inside the home without meeting the requirements for one.\n\nHe was suspended for two days for demonstrating inefficiency, negligence, or incompetence in the performance of duties.\n\nWhat the family wants\n\nThe family wants a jury trial and for the estate to be awarded nominal, compensatory and punitive damages.\n\nNewsChannel 5 is reaching out MNPD for its response to the lawsuit.\n\nGet NewsChannel 5 Now, wherever, whenever, always free.

Experts say gains won by unions could spur more organising and motivate non-unionised companies to try to stave off those efforts.\n\nThe UAW's talks, replete with weekly addresses by union President Shawn Fain, were among the most unabashed. The union came to tentative agreements with Ford Motor and Chrysler parent Stellantis in recent days, followed by General Motors early today.\n\n\"This is a set of negotiations, historically, where gains made in Detroit would be viewed and adapted by many other industries across the economy,\" said Harley Shaiken, labour professor at the University of California, Berkley.\n\nUnion worker compensation has finally caught up to non-union wage increases dating from the Covid-19 pandemic, according to US federal data, as the labour market has remained tight with unemployment at just 3.8 per cent.\n\nThe tentative deals are expected to amount to total pay hikes of more than 33 per cent when compounding and cost-of-living increases are factored in. The agreements may be a selling point for non-union shops to push for unionisation, said San Francisco State University labour and employment professor John Logan.\n\n\"The Big Three would want the UAW to organise Tesla,\" he added.\n\nNissan and other competitors may feel compelled to boost wages to retain their workforce. The union made its intention to expand autoworker unionisation clear in a series of posts on social media late Sunday that highlighted the length of the contract, which ends in 2028.\n\n\"One of our biggest goals coming out of this historic contract victory is to organise like we've never organised before,\" the UAW wrote. \"When we return to the bargaining table in 2028, it won't just be with the Big Three, but with the Big Five or Big Six.\"\n\nPublic support for unions has helped engagement in traditionally unionised industries such as manufacturing and healthcare. A Reuters poll showed the majority of Americans stand behind striking workers.\n\nEmployee-led unionisation efforts at retailers, such as Amazon and Starbucks, have reflected a consensus among workers who see unions as a means to secure better wages and working conditions.\n\nOrganisation has been difficult in recent years. About 11.3 per cent of workers were represented by unions last year compared with 23.6 per cent in 1982, according to data analysed by the Economic Policy Institute.\n\nThe UAW contracts are among many deals reached this year, along with agreements at UPS and construction equipment maker Caterpillar. Workers at other companies, like Mack Truck and equipment makers CNH Industrial and Deere & Co have all rebuffed initial deals despite raises that in some contracts appeared significant.\n\nIncreased awareness among workers about record profits has translated to company concessions and improved deals, said Marcos Feldman, senior researcher at Jobs to Move America, a labour organising nonprofit.\n\n\"The task is to solidify and institutionalise it,\" Feldman said. \"Unionising efforts are the most aggressive they've ever been.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden considers unions a cornerstone of his economic policies, including the US$1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure law to boost American manufacturing.\n\nEmployers may respond by boosting worker pay to hold off union efforts, or step up efforts to prevent unionisation.\n\nSome Starbucks employees have claimed the coffee chain illegally retaliated against organisers by firing employees and closing stores. Earlier this month the US Department of Labour ordered the company to disclose documents pertaining to anti-union spending.\n\nAmazon has dissuaded unionisation, with the National Labour Relations Board (NLRB) recently ruling the e-commerce giant had threatened to withhold wages and benefits from employees at two New York warehouses.\n\nUPS and its rivals\n\nThe UPS deal in August raised pay and eliminated a two-tier wage system for drivers at the Atlanta-based company. That bolstered organising efforts among Amazon workers and put pressure on UPS rivals to close a growing gap in pay.\n\nWhen the new UPS agreement expires in 2028, the average full-time US driver will make about US$170,000 (RM810,135) annually in pay and benefits, significantly more than peers employed by contractors for Amazon and FedEx.\n\nAmazon in September gave delivery contractors US$440 million for the year to raise average driver pay to an estimated US$20.50 per hour. Amazon told Reuters that payment was part of normal increases and not influenced by the UPS contract. It did not provide prior-year comparisons. FedEx said it regularly reviews pay for directly employed delivery workers to ensure that it is competitive and that its delivery contractors set their own wage rates.\n\n\"One thing we've seen in this economy is that workers are more likely to quit when they are unhappy,\" said Kate Bronfenbrenner, director of labour education research at Cornell University. \"Industries where they're more likely to stay are the ones where they unionise and they stay and fight.\" -- Reuters",

One is about bad pharma (yet again!), while the second is like a Gen-Z X-Files.\n\nPain Hustlers (Netflix USA) - This could be an example of how the streaming channel's algorithm will have them repeatedly drawing from the same well, even when it's empty. Bad Pharma and the opiod crisis have been done several times over. Dopesick was on another streaming platform, and we saw Netflix immediately jump on that bandwagon. Even the Flanagan adaptation of Poe's House of Usher replaced the source material's incest with bad pharma, and now we get this attempt to humanize the Fentanyl story. We achieve this via the story of Liza Drake, a single mother who was just out to support her daughter and found out she was good at selling, and doing so for a mediocre drug company that was ready to cut corners with their 'revolutionary' medicine.\n\nIt's sad to see the excellent cast of Emily Blunt, Chris Evans, and Andy Garcia working with a noted Director such as David Yates (several Harry Potter and Fantastic Beasts films) but bogged down by an uneven screenplay and subject matter that feels tired and dated. Emily Blunt is watchable and the best thing here, but even she can't keep this sinking ship afloat. Chris Evans surprised us with Knives Out by taking on a character we'd dislike; here, it looks like he's just doing the same thing without giving his portrayal any texture or nuance - enough with the anti-Captain America stance. It's now become too predictable. Honestly, one can do better than watching this film. Head back to Dopesick if you really want to watch a story of Bad Pharma unfold.\n\nMonsters of California (Amazon Prime on Demand) - Here's a film that could quickly have fallen through the cracks and been ignored; but the fact that there's 'Directed and co-written by Blink 182's Tom deLonge' has sparked interest among music fans of this seminal rock band. A confessed UFO fanatic, deLonge takes that obsession to task, as the film takes a band of young boys on a voyage of self-discovery amidst strange occurrences, the supernatural and the other-worldly. It's an X-Files mish-mash of all these elements and a coming-of-age tale filled with teenage angst and disappearing Dad issues. Does it all work, though? Let's find out!\n\nDallas (Jack Samson), Riley (Jared Scott), and Toe (Jack Lancaster) are the gang of three that we follow, with Dallas the best drawn of the three. He's the one with a military father who inexplicably disappeared. Kelly (Gabrielle Haugh) is the love interest, and Meg (Camille Kostek) is Dallas' sister. Right off, one criticism one can level on deLonge is that the women are mere cut-out non-characters, just there for the guys to look normal or to say he did cast women. They don't contribute to the narrative at all. If I were brutally honest, the film's tone is never quite established, and deLonge seems to have bitten off more than he can chew. Back to music and touring, please!",

This new facility will be built at the Shreve Park Industrial Campus just off of Highway 3132 near West 70th. This Amazon complex will be about 87,000 square feet. Construction is expected to start in the next few weeks.\n\n\"Shreveport is a great place to live and work, and we're pleased to be setting local roots here,\" said Jessica Breaux, Amazon Senior Manager of Economic Development. \"With the opening of our state-of-the-art fulfillment center that is slated for next year and now this delivery station, we will be hiring for more than 1,000 local, good jobs and able to serve customers faster and better in and around Shreveport. We appreciate the support of our great partners, including the North Louisiana Economic Partnership, the Greater Shreveport Chamber of Commerce, City of Shreveport, and Caddo Parish.\"\n\nThe jobs at this complex will pay between $17 and $28 per hour. Between this complex and the Amazon Fulfillment Center in north Shreveport, Amazon will hire about 1,000 workers.\n\nMayor Tom Arceneaux says \"In welcoming Amazon's decision, I am thrilled to announce that Shreveport and Caddo Parish are now at the forefront of innovation and progress.\" \"This significant milestone not only marks an exciting chapter for our community but also reinforces Shreveport's position as a key player in the global marketplace. Together, we are building a future where opportunities flourish and dreams find their wings.\"\n\nThe Robotics Fulfillment Center is still set to open in the middle of next year. This last mile facility is where customer orders are prepared for delivery.\n\n\"In business, there's no finish line, only mile markers, and each one of those counts toward the goal,\" said Parish of Caddo District 7 Commissioner Stormy Gage-Watts. \"I'm thrilled to be a part of the footprint and excited to welcome new business opportunities to District 7 and Caddo Parish.\"\n\nThe company has been working directly with the Greater Shreveport Chamber of Commerce, which owns and manages the Shreve Park Industrial Campus, and the North Louisiana Economic Partnership, the regional economic development organization supporting Caddo Parish. The team worked to ensure that the facility and surrounding infrastructure could meet the needs of the company's intended purpose.\n\n\"The Chamber is so pleased that Amazon has chosen ShrevePark as the location for their local last mile facility,\" said Dr. Tim Magner, President of the Greater Shreveport Chamber. \"An additional tenant of this caliber at ShrevePark highlights the ongoing opportunities for economic growth in our region and once again validates Shreveport's value as a distribution nexus.\"\n\nData from the North Louisiana Economic Partnership says one in five Americans lives within a 500-mile radius of Shreveport, making the city enviable for distribution and logistics companies. Ample transportation and connectivity throughout the area offer businesses like Amazon seamless access to multiple markets.\n\n\"We congratulate Amazon and thank them for their commitment to the Shreveport community,\" said North Louisiana Economic Partnership President & CEO Justyn Dixon. \"This additional investment is a testament to our excellent business climate and the advantages of our geographical location in North Louisiana.\"",

        "body": "FARGO -- Before the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) protests began in 2016, Karen Van Fossan felt lonely, but she didn't know why.\n\nBefore the controversy Van Fossan, a Unitarian Universalist minister living in Fargo, had a longing for an experience of wholeness in the human community.\n\n\"I had a certain kind of chronic loneliness that I now connect with my colonial culture, and its ways of isolating people and dehumanizing everyone in very different ways and very different extents,\" she said.\n\nRecently, she finished and published a book called \"A Fire at the Center: Solidarity, Whiteness, and Becoming a Water Protector,\" which is more than a memoir, but a cultural critique.\n\nAccording to Pierce Alquist, marketing director for the publisher Skinner House Books, Van Fossen's book \"takes readers behind the scenes of the Dakota Access Pipeline conflict, to penitentiaries where prisoners of war have carried the movement onward, to the jail cell where she was held for protesting Line 3, to a reimagining of decolonized family constellations and to moments of collective hope and strength.\"\n\nDuring her time living and working at resistance camps near Standing Rock and in Minnesota, \"I began to feel like a whole person in a whole community in a way that I had deep in my bones believed could be possible, but also feared I would never experience.\n\n\"And then I did,\" Van Fossan said. \"It wasn't perfect by any means. It wasn't a utopia, but it didn't have to be to be whole.\"\n\nThe author said her time at camps offered her that important understanding.\n\nAfter law enforcement closed down the camps, evicting everyone, Van Fossan felt a grief that she knows she will never stop feeling.\n\n\"At the same time, I think I have a deeper trust about what human beings might be capable of in terms of living a truly good life rooted in collected values,\" she said.\n\nWith feelings of trust and grief still with her, Van Fossen wrote the book to express gratitude to those who made the camps possible. Some in public ways, some in humble ways, some in both.\n\n\"It's a message of gratitude,\" Van Fossan said about her book.\n\nDuring the months-long DAPL protest, Van Fossan was living between the resistance camps and in Bismarck where her church helped protesters behind the scenes. When mass arrests occurred, she and others helped transport people back to Oceti Sakowin, where the protesters lived.\n\nShe remembered when the pipeline's original route was near Bismarck, and the protests before the route was moved to cross the Mississippi River near Standing Rock Sioux Reservation.\n\n\"We had a level of privilege where we didn't have to resist and be heard, it was a level of resistance where we didn't even have to be heard,\" Van Fossan said of protests that occurred before the pipeline's route was moved.\n\nHer church in Bismarck was targeted at times because of the stance it took against Energy Transfer Partners, the parent company of the Dakota Access Pipeline, and the help it gave protesters.\n\nThe camps that Van Fossan lived and worked in were an \"indescribable human phenomenon,\" she said.\n\nAs long as the camps persisted the protest, the resistance would continue to grow, Van Fossen said.\n\n\"We were there by the water. We were there by the fire, a sacred fire,\" she said. \"There was so much power there.\"\n\nAnd after her experiences, including being arrested during a protest on Line 3 in Minnesota, she knows she doesn't have the answers. But that's okay, Van Fossan said.\n\n\"There are times and ways where we do get to glimpse and practice a cultural shift and a cultural change and I think it's going to take -- for us white people -- a combination of humility and courage,\" she said. \"I definitely was taught that I don't have any business on sharing my view on any topic unless I have an answer.\"\n\n\"That's part of why so many white people who were part of camp life were so relieved and enlivened and transformed, because our culture doesn't hold those answers,\" she continued. \"Our willingness to notice that and say so is crucial to any kind of large-scale transformation that we would hope to make.\"\n\nVan Fossan's book is available to purchase on Amazon and on Kindle, at Zandbroz Variety in downtown Fargo, and elsewhere. She will have a book signing and reading Thursday, Nov. 30, 6:30 p.m. at Zandbroz.",

Currently, New York City (8.3 million) and Los Angeles (3.8 million) are the most populated cities in America.\n\nThe study used data from the U.S. Census Bureau to examine metropolitan areas across the country with more than 250,000 residents. MoveBuddha then took the 2010-2020 U.S. Census growth rates for each area and projected population growth for the next 77 years.\n\nDallas-Fort Worth was already the fourth fastest growing metro area in the country in 2023, per the study. But if the current growth rates continue, the Metroplex is in for a huge growth spurt.\n\nPeople are also reading...

As for why Dallas-Fort Worth is seeing the population bump, the study stated that people are being influenced by remote work and wanting to move near loved ones.\n\nAnother factor is that major tech companies such as Tesla, Hewlett-Packard, Apple and Amazon opened corporate campuses or relocated their headquarters to Texas in recent years, drawing employees to its cities, including Fort Worth and Dallas.\n\nCalifornia, Texas lead the nation for most disaster-prone states.
